Hey shar, 

The script looks great and brings out Milanote's value really well - great work!

I am happy to approve this and for you to go ahead and start filming. Here are some reminders on screen-recordings so that we can make sure that minimal to no edits are required on the video: 

- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I can't wait to see this come to life soon!!

So I brainstormed with Milanote – who also happens to be the sponsor for this video (ohh sponsor jumpscare)! I’ve actually used this tool before for college, mainly for its easy-to-use flowchart system and the fact that you can share your boards with friends. So yeah, I planned out the main algorithm for my thesis with my thesis partner in Milanote, and I also apparently also used it for my internship at some point?? These memories escape me…

Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects, and it’s absolutely a tool for people whose train of thought is on the messy side (perfect for me), because it’s essentially a board you can pin sticky notes and other stuff like images, videos, etc, onto. You can even put boards in boards, so you can organize your messy train of thought recursively. It kind of feels like a desktop with folders and icons, if that makes any sense.

I used Milanote for planning mainly three things: the visual direction and moodboard, the different windows and features, and the main functions I’ll be using when I start programming it. I already had a general idea of what I wanted so I just kept tacking on sticky notes or doodling over said sticky notes whenever I had a new idea. It was really satisfying placing them on the grid and rearranging things to fit what I was thinking at that time.

There are also a bunch of pre-made templates to choose from for different types of projects. I personally think it’s a really good tool if you’re planning to start work on a game or other creative project, especially if you struggle a bit with regular note apps.

Himika",,,4,"To plan this project, I have been using Milanote, a tool for organising and planning creative projects. Using MIlanote for my jinx doll has been such an asset in the creative process as its designed to act as a visual mood board. Allowing me to catalogue my web links, reference images, colour swatches, notes and much more. 

On the front page of my jinx board, I’ve included the Arcane 3D model sculpted by Tebalt Grannet, along with quick links to his portfolio on ArtStation which has the original model along with various renderings. With everything linked on the board, I can access his high-res work instantly without keeping tabs open all day—a huge convenience!

Milanote lets you organize your ideas the way you think. I'm quite a visual thinker, I tended to save reference images to a photodump, writing illegibly in notebooks and sticking papers to the wall. so being able to Drag and drop, cluster or stack elements brings clarity to an otherwise chaotic workflow.

One of the internal boards I created was the Design board, that ill use for sculpting and painting. I’ve layered the reference images for Jinx’s animation rigs, alongside my guideline sketches that I use when sculpting. 

Also on this board is everything I need for the painting stage—I have the preferred reference images, paired with my itemised list of paints, my painting guide, as well as fleeting notes that I want to remember. I'm also able to sketch directly onto the board for visual reminders like this [show], and add elements like colour swatches which you can sample directly from the board.


With such a variety of elements to use, I'm able to have that structure as well as flexibility, which is essential when organising a creative project.

Something i liked was the variety of temples to choose from, You can browse through and find the perfect fit for your project.
While the visual mood board approach works for the painting and sculpting aspect, I was able to use their craft project timeline template to create an itemised to do list and timeline.

This keeps my notes neat, while still providing that very visual way of organising. 

Milanote’s real-time collaboration feature also allows you to share boards with collaborators. So you can brainstorm together which is such valuable asset when working on creative projects.

Hey Phoebe, 

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! Excited to be collaborating with you. 

The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you would use Milanote to actually plan and conceptualize the process of designing your doll from scratch. 

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside your tailored Creative Brief (https://www.notion.so/milanote/Etellan-Creative-Brief-a2ac8a163c19452092fa6d8903c107a5).

Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link)

Hey Viyaura, thanks so much for sharing your script! This sounds wonderful. Here are a couple of suggestion to improve your script. 
- Please mention this description in the Introduction: ""Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.”
- Mention what kinds of built-in templates are available i.e. interior design, filmmaking is (you can show the visual arts templates)
- You could also mention what other future projects you hope to plan in Milanote.

Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s
For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.
Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! Many thanks, Bella",,,4,"Milanote Integration: (~2 minutes)

Moodboarding is another great way to conceptualize and visually organize what you want your art style to encompass
A great tool to organize your references or inspiration is on Milanote
I have my main project board here, and a few sub-boards with specific character design or brushes
A lot of my inspiration comes from Pinterest, and what I love is you can make a direct link to the site so you can easily relay back to the original artist/source
And you can see I’ve made to-do lists, small notes, headers. You can even draw/make small sketches 
They also have built-in templates if organization isn’t your forte 
Although I use Milanote for solo projects, you can easily collaborate and share your work on Milanote by inviting others to leave feedback
CTA “so definitely try out milanote– it's available for free with no time limit. So check it out using the link in the description and start your next creative project”",,,true,true,"Hey Viyaura, thanks so much for sharing your script! This sounds wonderful. Here are a couple of suggestion to improve your script. 
- Please mention this description in the Introduction: ""Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.”
- Mention what kinds of built-in templates are available i.e. interior design, filmmaking is (you can show the visual arts templates)
- You could also mention what other future projects you hope to plan in Milanote.

Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Moodboarding is another great way to conceptualize and visually organize what you want your art style to encompass
A great tool to organize your references or inspiration is on Milanote
I have my main project board here, and a few sub-boards with specific character design or brushes
A lot of my inspiration comes from Pinterest, and what I love is you can make a direct link to the site so you can easily relay back to the original artist/source

Hey Viyaura,
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea—this sounds fantastic! Excited to see what you come up with! Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Hey Hana, 

The script is absolutely AMAZINGG!! Really really great work with bringing out Milanote's value and keeping it so authentic. Also, great job putting a CTA in the middle as well considering it is a long integration :) 

 I am happy for you to record your draft video for this. Here are some reminders on screen-recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I can't wait to see this come to life soon!!

",,,4,"Part 1 Ad:
-Before we get into the nitty gritty of the rigging work though, I really want to tell you guys about the sponsor of today’s video, Milanote. We’re big fans of Milanote here, I genuinely use Milanote on all my projects now, including this VTuber model. It’s spectacular and easy, and I’m excited to show you guys how I use it. 
-So Milanote is essentially a tool you can use for organizing your creative projects. It’s convenient to use because it’s a browser tool, meaning I could access my same board from my phone or computer. What makes Milanote different from other organizational tools is the amount of fluidity and freedom you get in its unstructured workspace. My brain works in such an odd way that I naturally stray away from anything with overpacked calendars, word vomits, or numbers. Milanote feels more like a crazy little wallspace where you can pin ideas on and, even having those red strings of mystery connecting concepts. My mouse brain is very, very happy when I can be as aesthetic or messy as I want depending on the project.
-I use Milanote for practically everything now, like jotting down ideas for future projects, collecting references, and making detailed schedules for my workflow. Lucky for everyone, I don’t have to keep all my crazy ideas in my head now and explode from overthinking.
-For this VTuber project, I started out with a main board that holds all the sub-boards for certain parts of the rigging. This is sort of like the front page of everything, and it segments all my thinking into different areas of the body. I like to add little sticky notes and comments to remind myself of what I need to focus on in each stage, and even just encouraging words, cause you know we girlbossin’. I also add arrows and such to keep track of what’s next. I created this pseudo calendar using the Table element.
-As we enter our first sub-board, this holds a detailed guide on rigging the eyes. It shows exactly how things should look at each point, and I use the Drawing function to indicate what is happening during the movement. As we scroll down, you can see I’ve also included references for neat new features, should I want to add them.
Making your board is extraordinarily easy with the Template Picker tool. I just pick a template, then replace, and add or remove things as necessary.
-Okey dokey, so later on in this video, I will actually talk more in depth about how I plan out and do really dope physics, effects and animations on my VTuber model using Milanote. So, please, please look forward to that later.
-But, if you wanna try out Milanote right now, you can go ahead and sign up using my link in the description to start planning your next creative project! It’s completely free! For now, let’s get back to the video and see where our project leads us to!

Part 2 Ad:
-Okay, so this is the perfect time to pull out Milanote and really map out our plan for these next model physics. I’ve got 3 different types of physics I want to approach on this model, including accessories, ribbons, and special effects. We’re gonna use Milanote to organize our ideas, create a game plan, and really visualize how this is going to look.
-I’m going to create my main board for this, that will hold our sub-boards. I include a bunch of pretty images of accessories and animations that I love to set the tone and direction of the project. Then, I’ll write a general plan for each stage.
-For our accessory sub-board, I’ve included a check-list of things I need to do, including drawing sparkly assets, and creating the parameter motions for the effects. I’ve made a mock up of how I imagine the parameters will look like, and different techniques I’ll use to accomplish them. I also included clips of jewelry sparkling in action for inspiration. References are going to be key here as I add notes and circle things that I want to remember.
-For our ribbons sub-board, I took some screenshots of a ribbon in action to capture how it moves. Then, I use our line tool to actually map out the flow of the ribbon at each subsequent second. I plan to try to mimic this motion in the rig. So in Live2D, I capture the first curvature in one parameter, then the second curving motion in the second parameter. After messing around with the physics a bit, it looks pretty close to our reference clip, so I’m quite happy!
-For our effects sub-board, I spent a long time scouring the internet for different effects and tidbits I could add to my model, especially the arm poses. I first had to draw out each little effect, which included lots of sparkles, flowers, and more. So I included a list of what I needed to draw and different references. Then, I made mockups of the actual animation using Photoshop and included them as gifs on the board, with notes on how to achieve it as well as timing. I used the table element to map out the timing of the effects, including which frame should something appear. There’s even room for my partner to collaborate with me and add notes or comments on what should be adjusted, for example here we’ve noted that the edges of the star should lengthen before flying off. Having all this planned out beforehand saved me a ton of headaches.
-And that is how I use Milanote, a powerhouse of an organizational tool, to take my creative projects to the next level. And the best part about all this is that Milanote is available for free with no time limit. So again, you can sign up using my link in the description and use Milanote to plan your next creative project! I really could not recommend it enough because your ideas deserve to be out there, and not stuck in your brain with a chance of being forgotten. Thank you so, so much to Milanote for sponsoring today’s video. I could not have done this without them, so please check them out!
And now, back to the video and more physics shenanigans!",,,true,true,"Hey Hana,

It’s perfect for creative projects of all kinds, and even helped me with the making of today’s video.

Milanote also makes it so easy to work with images which is great since I tend to work better visually. You can drag and drop photos or files with ease and efficiently proportion them to your liking (show example). Everything is extremely creator friendly, providing smooth and non-distractive workflow.

Hey Monica, 

Really great job with the video - it is truly impressive!! I am happy to approve it but just had a couple of minor edits:

- when you show the Milanote website after introducing Milanote (at 11:26), it would be great if you could just jump straight into showing a screen recording of your boards as we have found that showing the webpage adds no value for the audience. 

- also when you display your Call to Action link on the screen at the end of the integration (at 17:20) it is should monicarazak0724 instead of simply monicarazak. 

Thanks for your amazing work on this :)

Hey Monica, 

The script looks absolutely fantastic!! You have done a great job bringing forward Milanote's value and linking it to your own project. 

Feel free to get started on your draft video. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click in on the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing this come to life soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

The script looks awesome! You have again gone into a lot of detail which is amazing. 
Some minor feedback: 
- When you talk about collecting references on your Milanote board can you please talk about Milanote's web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) and how it allows to add references to the board directly without having to copy paste. 
- As you go through the boards, can you please refer to the Milanote features you are using. 
- For your outro to the integration, can you please include: ""Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project.”

Happy for you to start your draft video. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click in on the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing this come to life soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Hey Cameron, 

The script looks great and I am happy to approve it. Great work!!

Just one small note: where you say ""But don’t take my word for it, give Milanote a go for your next project and experience it for yourself!"" can you please add a line saying something along the lines of ""I have added a link for you in the description box"". It would help to have a CTA in the middle of the video as well.

MILANOTE, yes the sponsor of this video who is paying my lovely rent, is my preferred way for planning while making games, coming up with ideas, and even writing the script for this video.

Milanote is the perfect visual tool for organizing any sort of creative project. It has boards where you can place anything from text, to images, to tables, and my favorite parts are sub-boards, so I can get lost in the infinite loop of my mind’s thoughts.

My favorite part is that I can easily invite my friend to my board and we can edit it in real-time, but it usually ends up in a drawing competition.

They have tons of templates that you can use to plan your projects
like this Brainstorming one where you can post your big brain inspiration images to come up with the perfect levels for your game.

Milanote has a great starting template for every step of the game development journey or really any project you do,

And once you've hashed out the idea, you can easily keep track of development milestones and your budget all in Milanote.

Hi Bella/Milanote, Here's the draft of the Integrated part of the video! I'm excited to finish editing the main video and combine everything once I'm done editing it.

Thank you so much for the patience!

Hey Shuen, thanks so much for sharing your draft video - you did a great job with this. I have two bits of feedback to provide - 
1. Milanote homepage screen recording - We find the audience tends to skip the integration when the homepage is shown, it would be great if you could show your boards instead or you can use this b-roll clip: https://media.milanote.com/p/files/1RTKkF1tXSXT3l/Uff/Illustration%20template%20video%20.mp4 
2. I noticed you spelled 'Melanote' instead of 'Milanote' in the recording (please refer to screenshot’s ). Also the correct call to action is this: https://milanote.com/shuenart Can you please make these updates and share the final version for a quick approval. Thank you, Bella

Hey Amanda, 

The script looks great!! I love how well you have brought forward Milanote's value and have explained each feature through your own project - this is exactly what we look for!

Just a couple suggestions - can you also talk about the 'due date' feature when you talk about the to-do lists/tasks and how it will send you a reminder email closer to the date. Also could you please mention somewhere in the video that Milanote has over a 100 built- in templates to help start any type of creative project extremely easy ( and show a couple of templates on your screen recording at this point). 

From here, I am happy for you to start drafting your video!

Here are some tips for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Hey Amanda and Lincoln,

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! Excited to be collaborating with you. The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you use Milanote to organize your renovation project.

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing the video soon! (: ",,,4,"[Intro: I’m on screen]
Hi divas! Hopefully, you’re all caught up on my mammoth video about Katy Perry’s career decline from last week. I’m so proud of it. It was a super long script that took me forever to organize, but it would’ve taken a LOT longer without today’s sponsor….  

[Screen cuts to Milanote logo]
This video is sponsored by Milanote, the essential tool for organizing creative projects. 

[Screen: Using Milanote on laptop/tablet, showing off my board]
Milanote is like a giant visual canvas that lets me gather my ideas, notes, and research all in one place. For someone like me with ADHD, it’s hard to keep everything organized in a linear way. But with Milanote, I can drop my thoughts as they come, visually see everything, and then piece it together into a narrative later on while writing my mammoth scripts. 

[Close-up of the board with images, notes, and videos related to Katy Perry's career]
Last week, when I was researching my script (the most time-consuming part of creating for me), I used Milanote to organize everything—Katy Perry’s key moments, career highlights, background research on her industry journey, the inevitable decline, all of it. And I didn't need to worry about having it all figured out immediately. Milanote lets me move things around until the story fits how I want it to. 

[Adding images and notes to a Milanote board]
Here’s what I mean: I can pull in notes, visuals, and even videos—all in one space. Working on different parts of the script in a non-chronological order allows me to capture all of my best ideas without feeling like I’m going to break my brain by forcing it to be linear. It’s perfect for people like me who don't think in a straight line.

[Screen: Showing different template options in Milanote]
Milanote also has built-in templates for everything from writing scripts to planning projects, which is super helpful for any creative professional—whether you're a filmmaker, designer, or writer.

[I’m back on screen]
So, if you need a way to keep your ideas organized, especially if your brain works like mine, give this a try. Milanote is available for free with no time limit, so sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in my description! It’s honestly made scriptwriting so much smoother for me.

Working on different parts of the script in a non-chronological order allows me to capture all of my best ideas without feeling like I’m going to break my brain by forcing it to be linear. It’s perfect for people like me who don't think in a straight line.

[Screen: Showing different template options in Milanote]
Milanote also has built-in templates for everything from writing scripts to planning projects, which is super helpful for any creative professional—whether you're a filmmaker, designer, or writer.

[I’m back on screen]
So, if you need a way to keep your ideas organized, especially if your brain works like mine, give this a try. Milanote is available for free with no time limit, so sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in my description! It’s honestly made scriptwriting so much smoother for me.

[Final screen: Milanote logo + CTA text]
Thanks again to Milanote for sponsoring this video. I can’t wait to show you what’s next!",,,true,true,"This sounds wonderful! For the screen recordings I recommend seeing the video examples inside the creative brief: Pro Tip: Notice how the example screen recordings effectively showcase Milanote - They display various boards, demonstrate dragging and dropping elements, and illustrate the process of building boards in real time. The toolbar is visible, and each board is clearly titled, making navigation intuitive. The recordings also show clicking into a board to demonstrate how board nesting works.
Looking forward to seeing the video soon! (: ",

It's great to hear your ideas for your project. We have new templates for planning content creation I would for you to check them out in the creative brief here: https://milanote.notion.site/Milanote-Creative-Brief-1e1edc06f95c45a38b1d56fec461a1b0.

",,,1,"My concept for this integration would be that as an ADHDer, I often have a hard time organizing my thoughts in a linear way: sometimes my best ideas come out in fits and spurts that seem unrelated. Milanote really accommodates that spontaneous creativity visually, and I can see it helping me to put together a narrative timeline with all of these disparate thoughts by being able to see the notes/image prompts/concepts all together at once rather than scripting in a straightforward 'essay' type of way. I think this would be enormously helpful to anyone who has difficulties with either creating or digesting large chunks of text!",,,true,true,"Hey Zachary!

Hey William, 

The script looks great and brings out Milanote's value really well - great work! Also, thank you for adding the visual description for each part of the script. 

I am happy to approve this and for you to go ahead and start filming. Even through I can see from your notes that you are definitely headed in the right direction, here are some reminders on screen-recordings so that we can make sure that minimal to no edits are required on the video: 

- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Himika",,,4,"This week's video is kindly sponsored by Milanote, and regular viewers might already know I’m a huge fan. I use Milanote daily to organize my projects, but another great way I use it is when I'm learning something new, like a photography technique. In the past, I would scribble loads of information on pieces of paper and inevitably lose them at some point. But not anymore. Now, I use Milanote to create aesthetically pleasing boards that I can reference time and time again.

Let me show you how I create my boards using some of the points I'm covering in today's video. For example, I've titled my board ""Color Photography Tips"" and added a nice shot of the XT5 as a visual reference point. Adding images is really easy—you can choose from stock photos, upload your own, or use the web clipper to grab an image from the web.
Milanote is fantastic because it lets you collect notes, photos, videos, tasks, and organize them in a way that makes sense. It’s truly a game-changer. As you can see, I've added notes and grouped them in columns to keep everything neat, and I've also added arrows to highlight important points. If you find an interesting article online, you can simply copy the link and paste it into your board, creating a live link back to the site. I find this incredibly helpful when learning something new.

You can also create sub-boards within your main board, which is great for keeping things organized. For example, this icon here is a sub-board I've created on how to correct a color cast. Let’s take a look. This visual flow diagram shows how I corrected a magenta color cast, and the color correction image is a simple screen grab from my Lightroom workflow. I've also created a checklist, which allows me to check things off as I work through a new workflow—really handy!

Creating a new board is super easy. Just drag in the new board icon, name it, and choose from one of Milanote's amazing templates. Say we want to create a mood board, for example. As you can see, we now have a ready-made board to get started with—it really is that simple.

Another feature I love is the ability to share a board with someone else. I can send this board to a friend so they can access all the information I've gathered. I use this feature all the time—it’s another great way to use Milanote.

One of the best things about Milanote is how easy it is to use, and they have over 100 built-in templates to get you started.

Hey Mohammed, 

Thanks for sharing your script - it looks great and I am happy to approve it :) 

Just one minor edit: instead of saying ""an interactive tool that helps you organize all the different files for your CREATIVE projects"" can you say something along the lines of ""helps you organise and visualise the planning stages of your creative projects"" 

Other than that, happy for you to put together your draft video. Here are some reminders on shooting screen-recordings for your video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for the great work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon!

",,,4,"Every now and then I like to compare my old art and the art I make currently to see if I’m improving, and also critic myself and find areas in my art I can improve on and get better. But it’s usually difficult organizing every drawing together and putting side by side on the same page so i reached out to the heavens for help and the art gods blessed me with milanote, the sponsor of today’s video. Milanote is an interactive tool that helps you organize all the different files for your CREATIVE projects on one platform so accessing them can be easier. Milanote allows you to collect and organize pictures, videos, notes and text, and arrange them into different boards using any of their built in templates that make it easy to start off your creative projects. You can also create several tasks for different things you want to study, and tick them when you’re done. For this instance, I’ll start by creating a general board where I’ll layout a broad overview that covers everything concerning the project I’m about to work on. next I’ll move on to place my references in a sub board and place my old art and current art in separate boards so I know where to find each of them. Then I create a new board where I place both drawings side by side so I can compare them, and also make notes on things I want to improve on or change. I like to use milanote’s web clipper tool when gathering screenshots from other artists that draw in a style I admire, and then save every image or screenshot I find useful In the board. 
 This also works well when you’re collaborating with other artists and working on the same project, so everyone has a good understanding of what the project is about and has access to the same references all at once since everything is properly organized in the same place.

Hi Alina,
Thank you for sharing your draft video! It’s excellent to see the boards on screen, but to give viewers a better sense of how you create them, we’d like to see more interaction. Including clips that show you dragging and dropping elements, rearranging items, and actively building your boards on-screen will enhance the viewer’s understanding of how Milanote works.
If you could replace a few clips with these interactive moments, it would be fantastic. Once you’ve made these updates, feel free to publish the video.

Hi Bobbo,

Thanks for sharing your draft video. I think it looks really good overall! My only suggestion before you go live is that you replace the screen recording of the Milanote homepage and login page at the end of the mention for one showing more of your boards. We've found that showing the homepage and login page doesn't add much value, and your boards look great so why not show them more! 

Let me know when the revised video is ready and I'll review it asap.

Hey Bobbo,
Thank you for sharing your script - this is great! Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s
For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.
Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box https://milanote.com/bobboandonova).

",,,4,"So behind my drawings, videos or work projects there is a lot of stuff to be organized…by me…(lot’s of drawings) But then one day…I found out Milanote. 

(ML logo, then Loading screen)

  Milanote is an app that is all about organization BUT in visual way.
I can put all of my photo references, notes, links, color palettes - all at one place without going crazy. 
  The catchy thing for me is that Milanote is a visual place so you get to create your board an organize everything however you want. 
  The other catchy thing - the interface is flexible - very easy to get used to and customize. 

(video of my dog on the tablet with Milanote open - text ""Even Benji can manage the boards"")

  They also have SO many  different templates by topics so if you don’t want to spend extra time you can take one of these and modify it...Yep, that's what I do! 

(video with templates)

  All of my boards I start with their template PROJECT PLAN in LOGO category. From there I modify it as want. 
  I love the option to write my notes directly on my drawings - this helps me to track every step of the process and makes my workflow clear. 

(still screen record videos)

  There is also the cool option to create color palette directly in the app - you can just drag the color option tool and pick colors directly from your inspiration images. 
  And yes, you can upload photos directly into the board but even better - you can just link your whole Pinterest boards like I did for this video.
  I have it on my Pc and I have it on my Pad cause it's really easy to have everything in one place. All of my refs, color pallets so I can grab my tablet and work wherever I go...I am really fun at parties. 

(tablet videos)

  So if you would like to bring some order your workflow especially if your designer or just a visual person that likes to see everything you're organized in a more visual way you can sign up for Milanote. It’s free with the link I put in my description.

Hey Bini, 

Great work on the script!! I am really impressed with it and happy to approve it :) Just one minor suggestion from my side: 

- It would be great to briefly touch upon the Web Clipper tool as well and how it allows you to directly add reference images to your board without having to take screenshots or copy-paste (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome)

Other than that, feel free to start recording your draft video. Here are some tips from me to make sure that minimal to no edit are required on the video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.


Thank you so much for your amazing work so far and I look forward to seeing this come to life soon!!

",,,4,"Thank you for the quick response! Below is the draft script for the Milanote integration:


- Bini3D character turns to address the viewer

Now, creating something as massive and detailed as a giant sea
monster starts way before the 3D modeling process even begins.
There’s planning your timelines, organizing ideas and
visualizing your final design. But, thankfully we have today’s
sponsor for this video- Milanote!

- Cut to Milanote logo

- Show main project board

Milanote is an online tool used for organizing ideas and
planning out creative projects, and that’s what we’re doing here
for our leviathans!

We’re given a huge canvas to work on, and all kinds of tools to
let us plan out and brainstorm on ideas, not to mention there’s
collaboration features so multiple people can work on a Milanote
project.

I’ve actually used Milanote in the past for this exact
thing, except instead of sea-monsters we were designing a short
indie game for a game-jam project.

- Show 'Design Plan' board

Now I’m using it here for these sea-monster designs, and having
options like sub-boards and being able to copy-paste pictures
right onto the canvas makes it super convenient to use on the
fly.

- Show adding a checklist to the ‘Design Plan’ board

It’s perfect for creatives like us, since a lot of us are visual
people, and the amount of customization means you can tweak it
to look and feel right for you.

- Show clicking into the 'Shark Moodboard' sub-board

We’ve got these sub-boards here for each sea-creature we’re
doing, one for the shark and one for the crustacean
respectively! Not to mention this design-plan board is a
sub-board in and of itself.

- Show backing out of 'Shark Moodboard' and 'Design Plan' to the main board

It’s great for managing everything without getting a bunch of
clutter everywhere and I can add notes, tasks, images, videos
and a bunch of other stuff all on here.

- Show template picker

It’s really easy to start up a project on Milanote, there’s over
100 hot-and-ready templates for any creative project you’d need!

- Show mood-board template

For example, I started off with the ‘mood-board’ template when I
started gathering all my inspiration and quickly got used to the
interface until I was able to organize everything for my
project, and no matter what it is you’re working on, Milanote’s
incredibly adaptable to your needs.

- Show 'Crustacean Moodboard' and add a comment

When you want to share your work, you can also invite others for
some feedback and collaborate with them in real-time!

- Cut back to Bini3D character

Milanote is available for free with no time-limit, so sign up
for a free Milanote account using the link in the description!
Thank you to Milanote for supporting this video, now let’s get
back into it.

Hey Cameron, thanks so much for sharing such a detailed script - it sounds fantastic! I had one small thought - are you able to move the call to action to the middle of the integration “Sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description.” Let me know if this is possible. You're welcome to start drafting the video. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box).

[Screen: me talking to the camera] 
So as I’m editing this video, I’m actually already working on my next one. And content creation – or really, any creative project, especially when you’re in the beginning stages of it – can be quite the challenge. When I get excited or passionate about an idea, I tend to have a thousand hyperactive thoughts just running through my brain. And because I don’t want to lose track of any of them, I need a quick, structured way of just organizing them all out in front of me. 

And honestly, [Screen: display the Milanote app on desktop] Milanote has been a godsend on that front. 

[Screen: cut to me editing my different boards] 
It’s a free, organizational tool for any creative project you may be working on, acting as a sort of canvas that allows you to visually plan out what you hope to achieve and what your next steps are in any given project. 

[Screen: creating a board on a plain canvas and going through the template menu] 
You start off by creating what’s called a “board”, which you can then turn into whatever visual planner you see fit through one of the over 100 templates available across multiple creative fields. So whether you’re in marketing, in film, in game design, or even a student looking to organize their assignments, this app has a tailored visual way of helping you structure your ideas.

[Screen: add various elements to my boards] 
I like how you can add notes to yourself and little extra visuals as you go - really helps in organizing everything in a way that makes sense and is appealing to you. 

[Screen: cut to back to me] 
It’s honestly perfect for a creator like me that can often get “lost in the sauce” of video research and visual editing, this really helps me map out my brain on screen.

We’ve noticed that videos that perform well typically start by explaining what Milanote is and who it’s useful for. I suggest showcasing your boards throughout the video while discussing your project in more detail later in the integration. Since many of your viewers may not be content creators, it would be beneficial to frame it in broader terms—like how Milanote aids brainstorming, creative ideas, and writing.

Hey callimara,

Thank you for making the edit and thanks for confirming that you will be talking through the features :) Feel free to get started on recording your draft video. 

Even though you might be already familiar with this, here are some reminders on creating a great screen-recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for all your great work on this and I look forward to seeing a draft of your video soon!

Best, 
Himika",,,4,"Edit: Hi Himika! Please see the amended script below! And yes I will be playing a screen recording of me completing my boards to demonstrate my Milanote use and be using the boards to explain some of the further story elements of my design.

So to organize and keep track of all the millions of ideas and connections that were just bestowed upon me from the heavens, I am once again teaming up with my favorite delusion-enabler, Milanote! Milanote is a tool that helps you organize ideas, compile inspirations and references to create your own moodboard, and list tasks you need to do, all in one, digital corkboard.
If you guys know me, you know I don’t PLAY when it comes to the research I do for my design projects, and Milanote also helps me grab bits of information and images really quickly with their web clipper tool which makes resource gathering a LOT easier! But sometimes I lose track of which scraps of inspo and info are for which bit and this means I completely forget to include certain components or bits of information entirely. But Milanote makes it a lot easier for me to keep all my references together and arrange it in a way that helps me keep my ideas and the associated references and evidence together so I don’t leave anything out!
So throughout this design/redesign process, you’ll see me referring to this board a LOT. And you guys know me, I am all about frenetic energy and organized chaos, keyword here being ORGANIZED, so because this board is a LOT already for anyone looking at it who isn’t me, Milanote’s sub-board feature really comes in handy here because it lets me move the OTHER sprawling board I made for the writing component.
And worry not, I will be walking you through every single step and stray thought I had during my design process using this board, and how you can use milanote to make your own character designs because I doubt my design would have turned out as well as it had without it! Planning is such an important and underlooked component of character design, so to help you up your planning game, you can also view this board and use it as a reference using the link in my description!
Also, if you’re thinking of doing something like this, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit. Just use the link in my description!
So thank you Milanote for sponsoring this video and let’s get right into my design board!",,,true,true,"Hey callimara,

So to organize and keep track of all the millions of ideas and connections that were just bestowed upon me from the heavens, I am once again teaming up with my favorite delusion-enabler, Milanote! Milanote is a tool that helps you organize ideas, compile inspirations and references to create your own moodboard, and list tasks you need to do, all in one, digital corkboard.
If you guys know me, you know I don’t PLAY when it comes to the research I do for my design projects, and Milanote also helps me grab bits of information and images really quickly with their web clipper tool which makes resource gathering a LOT easier! But sometimes I lose track of which scraps of inspo and info are for which bit and this means I completely forget to include certain components or bits of information entirely. But Milanote makes it a lot easier for me to keep all my references together and arrange it in a way that helps me keep my ideas and the associated references and evidence together so I don’t leave anything out!
So throughout this design/redesign process, you’ll see me referring to this board a LOT. And you guys know me, I am all about frenetic energy and organized chaos, keyword here being ORGANIZED, so because this board is a LOT already for anyone looking at it who isn’t me, Milanote’s sub-board feature really comes in handy here because it lets me move the OTHER sprawling board I made for the writing component.
And worry not, I will be walking you through every single step and stray thought I had during my design process using this board, and how you can use milanote to make your own character designs because I doubt my design would have turned out as well as it had without it! Planning is such an important and underlooked component of character design, so to help you up your planning game, you can also view this board and use it as a reference using the link in my description!
Also, if you’re thinking of doing something like this, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit. Just use the link in my description!
So thank you Milanote for sponsoring this video and let’s get right into my design board!",,,true,true,"Hey callimara,

Thank you for making the edit and thanks for confirming that you will be talking through the features :) Feel free to get started on recording your draft video. 

Even though you might be already familiar with this, here are some reminders on creating a great screen-recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for all your great work on this and I look forward to seeing a draft of your video soon!

Hey callimara, 

Great work on the script!! I am happy to approve this as long as you make sure that you Milanote's features (e.g. boards within boards, images, notes, the ability to draw/handwrite on boards) anywhere while going through your boards. Particularly, I think the web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) would be very relevant for you to talk about!

Also, an edit I want to point out in the script - where you say ""so to help you up your planning game, you can also view this board and use it as a reference using the link in my description!"" are you planning on adding a separate link to your board in your description box as well? If so, please make sure that you also mention your unique CTA link that will be in your description box to your audience as well. 

Again, thanks for the great work!

Hey callimara, 

I was really keen on getting an integration in one of your character re-design & rewrite videos if you have any planned for the coming the months. I feel that this video would be a better fit to show how Milanote can be used to plan a creative project, instead of just using your Milanote boards to explain a theory to your audience :)

Hey David, 

Great job on the video - I am happy to approve this!! And no problems about the extra time you need, we would rather have our creators take their time than feel rushed into publishing a video :))

I just have a couple pointers: 
- When you talk about the web clipper tool can you please avoid showing the Milanote website as we have found that it does not add much value for the audience. 
- Since we agreed on a 120s integration and this came up a little short to 90s, can you please mention a quick call to action at the end of your full video. 

Also, here's a quick reminder to include your unique CTA links when you publish the final video: 
- Top line of description box: Sign up to Milanote for free with no time-limit: https://milanote.com/doodley0724
- Pinned comment: Thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video! Sign up for free and start your next creative project: https://milanote.com/doodley0724

""I actually did a ton of research on all the different kinds of poses you can find in game development, and organized them in various categories using today’s sponsor Milanote, who were gracious enough to sponsor another one of my videos.

Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects, and as you can imagine, I tend to have a lot of those. Recently, I’ve been using Milanote to collect the changes I want to make to the Doodley and Gimberly rigs. Rather than writing them down in a text document, I can take screenshots of the areas I want to fix, add notes and ideas, and draw out the features I plan to add. It’s a lot more visual this way, which works great for me as a visual person.

Earlier in July, I also needed to create a moodboard for an artist I’m commissioning a T-shirt design from, so I used Milanote to organize everything, as well as their free web clipper tool. This way, I could clip any 3D references I wanted for the design directly to the board without copy and pasting, as well as stuff from Doodley, notes and suggestions I had, and specifications for the shirt design, all in one document. After it’s done, she can view the moodboard and even be added as a collaborator to edit it herself in real-time.

For this video, I organized all the reference poses I could find into various categories, and it really helped comparing certain poses side by side, like the two variations on A-poses I showed earlier. Plus, I can keep track of what games these weird poses come from, and write down my thoughts on why they’re posed that way for later in the video. And even if you’re not sure where to start with organizing your boards, Milanote offers over a 100 built-in templates you can edit and modify for any creative project you want.

As always, Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project. Thanks again to Milanote for sponsoring this video, and let’s get back into it.""",,,true,true,"Hey David,

- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects, and as you can imagine, I tend to have a lot of those. Recently, I’ve been using Milanote to collect the changes I want to make to the Doodley and Gimberly rigs. Rather than writing them down in a text document, I can take screenshots of the areas I want to fix, add notes and ideas, and draw out the features I plan to add. It’s a lot more visual this way, which works great for me as a visual person.

Earlier in July, I also needed to create a moodboard for an artist I’m commissioning a T-shirt design from, so I used Milanote to organize everything, as well as their free web clipper tool. This way, I could clip any 3D references I wanted for the design directly to the board without copy and pasting, as well as stuff from Doodley, notes and suggestions I had, and specifications for the shirt design, all in one document. After it’s done, she can view the moodboard and even be added as a collaborator to edit it herself in real-time.

For this video, I organized all the reference poses I could find into various categories, and it really helped comparing certain poses side by side, like the two variations on A-poses I showed earlier. Plus, I can keep track of what games these weird poses come from, and write down my thoughts on why they’re posed that way for later in the video.

Hey David, 

Great work on the script - it truly brings out Milanote's value really well. 

I just had a couple of notes: 
- When you say ""After it’s done, she’s able to view the moodboard without an account, and could even be added as a collaborator"" could you please avoid saying ""without an account"". 

- When you talk about collecting references could you please talk about Milanote's web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) and how it can be used to add references to the board directly without the need to copy paste. 

- Can you please talk about the built-in templates saying something along the lines ""Milanote makes it easy to start any type of creative project by offering over a 100 built-in templates"" and show a couple of these templates on the screen in the screen recording at this point. 

Thanks for all your hard work so far and I look forward to reviewing a revised script soon :)

I have a question, when mentioning Milanote for the first time in the video, is it mandatory to use the Milanote logo video? I personally think it kind of makes it too ""sponsored video"" kind of situation where viewers may think that I'm just saying all of these because it's a sponsored by you when all of it are my genuine opinions and thoughts.

Would it be possible to replace that with a text on my talking head footage instead?
""Sponsored by Milanote""

Below are some of the parts of the current script.
Let me know if you have a specific feature you want me to cover in the video:)

00:00  ~ 00:45 - Cinematography Reel

00:45  ~ 01:30 - Explanation about Importance of shot-list and overall pro-production for filmmakers

01:30  ~ 06:30 - My workflow of creating shot-list and more using Milanote

So I use Milanote to organize my entire projects including storyboard, shot-list and script you name it.
Every single information I just put them into Milanote and organize them so I can easily find them whenever I need them.

I’m pretty sure you’ve heard about them before but Milanote is a tool to organize your ideas and creative projects into visual boards.
And a lot of filmmakers are using it including myself and there’s a good reason for that. 
It’s easy to use and kind of fun to use as well.

Pre-production can be a little kind of boring sometimes but when I’m using Milanote, I can change the colors or the icons and customize things however I’d like to make it look like it’s actually inside my brain so it’s easier for me to come up with ideas and organize my thoughts if that makes sense.

It just makes the whole process a little more enjoyable and when I’m enjoying it, I get more creative. 


————————


One things that I like about Milanote is the ability to work in a group and what I mean by that is you can create an editable link and send it to whoever whether it’s people on your team or your client as well
and they can have a look, leave comments directly on here as well.

And then you can also add a color on the comment if you want, and use the arrow to reference which part I love. 
I can just send this off to whoever that I have working on it, they don’t need to be here with me or ask me to change that or that, they can just edit, make changes however they’d like and that way, I can better understand what they want and avoid miscommunication which is awesome.


————————


And after creating my shot-list, I used to print off everything on a piece of paper bring that to the shoot.
And that was great but you can lose it or don’t remember where you put it. but there’s no need anymore. Milanote also has an app that you can use with your phone or even ipad which you can view and also edit on the go so it stays with you all the time wherever you go and I can revisit anytime to really help keep myself on the original vision that I had because it’s very easy to stray away off into different directions 


—————————


They have pre-built templates here and some of them are specifically designed for pre-production so if you’re not really familiar with it or don’t know where to start, this is going to help you a lot. 


—————————


I found these images that are close to what I have in my mind mostly on Shotdeck or Youtube.
And a great thing about it is that I don’t have to download or screenshot then upload to be able to use them.
you can just copy an image from wherever you found it and then just paste it directly onto your Milanote board which is a lot quicker and simpler and also saves you a little bit of storage on your device.
And everything I copy and paste here pops up on the right side of the screen and when I’m done with my research, I can go in and start organizing everything later.

I’ve also pasted reference videos so that other people can watch and have a better idea about overall mood I’m going for.
And they can just play the video right here without leaving Milanote which is awesome.

Most of the time, I choose what music I want to use for the film and start building other things around it because it really helps set the right mood when developing the visual and or even the story as well and it also makes editing a lot smoother.
And I can just put it right here and play it which is great.

And It’s also really helpful to list out all the gear that you want to use. I do this all the time before I leave my house and after wrapping up the shoot as well to make sure I don’t forget anything 

When I’m making a film often times I randomly just come up with ideas that I go, oh that would be fun, what if I try that or that but then I completely forget about it so I always just write down all of those random ideas and later I can create a new column and just drop all of them in there and you can title it (ideas) . and I can start thinking about how I can actually use those ideas to help the storytelling.

Pre-production can be a little kind of boring sometimes but when I’m using Milanote, I can change the colors or the icons and customize things however I’d like to make it look like it’s actually inside my brain so it’s easier for me to come up with ideas and organize my thoughts if that makes sense.

It just makes the whole process a little more enjoyable and when I’m enjoying it, I get more creative. 


————————


One things that I like about Milanote is the ability to work in a group and what I mean by that is you can create an editable link and send it to whoever whether it’s people on your team or your client as well
and they can have a look, leave comments directly on here as well.

And then you can also add a color on the comment if you want, and use the arrow to reference which part I love. 
I can just send this off to whoever that I have working on it, they don’t need to be here with me or ask me to change that or that, they can just edit, make changes however they’d like and that way, I can better understand what they want and avoid miscommunication which is awesome.


————————


And after creating my shot-list, I used to print off everything on a piece of paper bring that to the shoot.
And that was great but you can lose it or don’t remember where you put it. but there’s no need anymore. Milanote also has an app that you can use with your phone or even ipad which you can view and also edit on the go so it stays with you all the time wherever you go and I can revisit anytime to really help keep myself on the original vision that I had because it’s very easy to stray away off into different directions 


—————————


They have pre-built templates here and some of them are specifically designed for pre-production so if you’re not really familiar with it or don’t know where to start, this is going to help you a lot. 


—————————


I found these images that are close to what I have in my mind mostly on Shotdeck or Youtube.
And a great thing about it is that I don’t have to download or screenshot then upload to be able to use them.
you can just copy an image from wherever you found it and then just paste it directly onto your Milanote board which is a lot quicker and simpler and also saves you a little bit of storage on your device.
And everything I copy and paste here pops up on the right side of the screen and when I’m done with my research, I can go in and start organizing everything later.

I’ve also pasted reference videos so that other people can watch and have a better idea about overall mood I’m going for.
And they can just play the video right here without leaving Milanote which is awesome.

Most of the time, I choose what music I want to use for the film and start building other things around it because it really helps set the right mood when developing the visual and or even the story as well and it also makes editing a lot smoother.
And I can just put it right here and play it which is great.

And It’s also really helpful to list out all the gear that you want to use. I do this all the time before I leave my house and after wrapping up the shoot as well to make sure I don’t forget anything 

When I’m making a film often times I randomly just come up with ideas that I go, oh that would be fun, what if I try that or that but then I completely forget about it so I always just write down all of those random ideas and later I can create a new column and just drop all of them in there and you can title it (ideas) . and I can start thinking about how I can actually use those ideas to help the storytelling.

Hey Agnes, 

Wow, the video is absolutely great!! I just have a couple quick edit requests:

- Could you please include that ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects"" and show the animated logo on the screen as per your script
- When talking about the built-in templates could you please show the templates in the Milanote platform instead of showing the website (just screen record clicking on any 1-2 templates). See this video at the 2:47 timestamp for a reference to illustrate this better (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra-vkj23r8w)
- Was it possible to quickly include a full screen recording of the Meshki moodboard somewhere in the initial 3 minute segment as I think it looks really beautiful with all your sketches

Thanks for all your beautiful work!!

Hey Agnes, 

The script sounds fantastic - great work! Love how you plan on interacting with the various elements and have personalized it so well to fit your crocheting project :)  

Just one small note: Where you say ""whether you're a crochet designer or fashion designer, Milanote makes starting a new project........"", could you please change that to ""whether you're a crochet designer or fashion designer or a creative in general, Milanote makes starting a new project....."" because we don't want the audience to get confused and think that Milanote is just limited to fashion projects. 

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on.   

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Additionally, it would be great if you could delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. This would help make the video more interactive and process focused. Also when you mention the built-in templates in your script, would be great if you could show a few built-in templates in the screen-recording at that point in the video. 

For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief. Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box https://milanote.com/yaejiyea).

Hey yaejiyea, 

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! Excited to be collaborating with you. The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you would use Milanote to actually plan and organize your crochet project. 

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link).

Hey Karin,

You have done a great job with the script, especially with bringing out Milanote's value and how natural you have kept it. Happy to approve it :)

Just wanted to request one addition: could you please briefly talk about the web clipper tool and how it allows you to add images to the boards directly without having to copy-paste/take screenshots (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome). 

Other than that, feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are my top screen-recording tips for you to make sure there are no/minimal edits required on the video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I can't wait to see this come to life soon!!

Himika",,,4,"Since we only had one day to explore Kyoto, we of course wanted to make the most of it. And due to that, this day trip required a bit more planning than usual as for example planning out the locations and route for the day but also the equipment and things to bring. And for that I used a tool called Milanote, who isn’t only the sponsor of this video but also an amazing tool I got very fond of lately.

Milanote is a free tool for organizing your creative projects - yes, you have heard right, you can sign up for free and try it our straight away, you only have to upgrade to a paid plan if you create a lot of boards. Milanote basically feels like a big canvas or notebook, it’s an open workspace where you can freely visualize, organize, brainstorm and collaborate on ideas.

I have for example used Milanote to plan this day trip to Kyoto but also Youtube video from the day that you are watching right now. Here I was able to gather all my research information for the trip about spots I wanted to see. It’s also possible to add google maps links to see the entire route in one glance. And what particularly helped me to plan this trip from a photographic side is that you can add images, links, colours or arrrows in no time which helped me to previsualize the type of images and scenes I want to look out for. 

Milanote offers so much flexibility that I have also used it for other projects like the planning and sequenzing of a future zine idea. I plan to bring out a zine about my Japan trip once I have scanned and edited all my images and Milanote is the perfect platform to work on it. I can throw in all my images, try out different pairing and sequencing but also save inspirations and work on ideas for the title or design of the zine.

So in my opinion Milanote is an ideal tool to plan shoots, youtube videos, moodboards, visual concepts and so much more. Milanote also offers over 100 built-in templates that can help to spark creativitiy when starting with a new project. Overall, I can highly recommend Milanote to every creative out there and as I said earlier, Milanote is free with no time limit - so sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description.",,,true,true,"Hey Karin,

You have done a great job with the script, especially with bringing out Milanote's value and how natural you have kept it. Happy to approve it :)

Just wanted to request one addition: could you please briefly talk about the web clipper tool and how it allows you to add images to the boards directly without having to copy-paste/take screenshots (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome). 

Other than that, feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are my top screen-recording tips for you to make sure there are no/minimal edits required on the video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).

Himika",,,4,"As you're looking at the gear that keeps you prepped and ready for a shoot, it's really important to think about your shot list and how you're going to plan things out. That’s a key part of choosing which gear to bring on a solo filmmaking trip.

When you’re on your own, having a solid plan is just as important as having the right gear. That’s where the sponsor of today’s video, Milanote, comes in.

As a solo filmmaker, having a clear vision is everything. This was especially true for a recent Lenovo campaign I shot for my socials. This project had me capturing a variety of dynamic shots across Tokyo, experimenting with creative transitions, and pulling inspiration for my post-production from some recent creative projects.

Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects, and for this shoot, it became my ultimate pre-production hub. I used it to build a detailed storyboard and shot list, mapping out transitions like the ""through the lens"" effect, where I pushed into the camera lens and transitioned to a new location.

With Milanote, I could visually lay out the entire sequence, adding reference images and notes for every angle and transition. For example, planning out the final shot of me silhouetted with the trains in the background—everything was done in pre-production on my Milanote board, ensuring I didn’t miss anything on shoot day.

I love how visually easy it is to manage everything. In a single mood board, I can drag and drop reference images, gear checklists, and lighting notes. For this specific shoot, I even created a sub-board with my shot list and script, so on shoot day, I knew exactly which shots matched which lines.

As a filmmaker, this kind of organization is invaluable. It helps me translate ideas from my studio directly into the real world with confidence, taking the guesswork out of pre-production and letting me focus on creating something I’m proud of.

And the best part? Milanote is completely free with no time limit. Click the link in the description to sign up and start planning your next creative project today.",,,true,true,"Hey Gaku,

Hey Tiffany, 

The script sounds fantastic - great work! Love how you have focused on your project and managed to talk about so many of Milanote's relevant features :)

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on. 

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)

[VO during Video] I had a lot of planning to do before we started this project since we were going to be on such a tight timeline and for that I used Milanote


[Milanote logo] Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects, and I used it to plan this deck project


[Mood board] It’s perfect for visual thinker like me because it allows me to organize my ideas in a way that makes sense 


[Main screen with all the boards] You can tell by looking at my main board that I’ve been using Milanote for a long time. I use it to plan all of my makeovers and I use several sub boards to organize my inspiration


[Deck project plan board] So this is the board for the Deck project and I found some pictures online that would help me see the overall vision of the project


[Spread sheet on project plan board then sub board product list] This over here is one of my favorite features because you can do a spreadsheet and since budget is an important part of this project being able to see the budget on the same screen as my project board is a big plus


[Product list sub board] I also added a list of the materials that we needed to buy, and I can check them off as we get them 


[Show using web clipper] I like that I can link the materials using the web clipper feature, which is an extension that you add to your web browser and while you’re shopping, you can easily add a picture of the product with the link to your Board


[Show adding a comment] Another cool feature is that you can Invite a friend or a client to your board and you can collaborate in real time. In my case I can share this with my dad since he was the one in charge of getting all of the materials all the way in New York. I could share this with him so that we both collaborate in the planning process. 


[Show screen multiple templates] If organizing your inspiration is something that is challenging, Milanote makes it really easy because they have over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project


[Phone screen shot] I also like using the Milanote mobile app because anytime I see something that gives me inspiration. I can take a picture of it and upload it to my project.


[Me talking] Milanote is available for free with no time limit so you can sign up by clicking the link in the description below so you can start working on your next creative project.",,,true,true,"Hey Tiffany, 

The script sounds fantastic - great work! Love how you have focused on your project and managed to talk about so many of Milanote's relevant features :)

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on. 

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)

Hey Tiffany,

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! Just a quick thought - would love if the integration could focus more on using Milanote to organize the deck project particular to this video than a general project organization. I think that would help it be more natural. 

The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards. 

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.

Also, here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link.

Hey pateseich, 

Really appreciate your flexibility here - thank you so much! The script looks fantastic and I am happy to approve it. 

Just one small addition: 
- could you please also briefly talk about the built-in templates (e.g. ""and if you are unsure about where to begin, Milanote offers over a 100 built-in templates for a variety of creative work"")

Other than that, feel free to put together your draft video. Even though you might already be familiar with these, here are some screen-recording tips: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Also, a note - we will be going on a blackout period from 11 Dec - 11 Jan during which we won't be going live with any sponsored content for the holidays. Please let me know if you would be able to go live before then, if not we can work out a time in January :)

- hey everyone! today, I'm finally sharing how I create portraits in my style. For this video, I'll be drawing Mingyu from Seventeen, he's been one of the most requested from you guys, and honestly, he's one of my favorites too.
- by the way, if you guys are curious about how I come up with ideas or how I pick references, some of you already know it---I've been using Milanote a lot to organize my art projects. I shared a link with you guys a while back, and I hope you've found it helpful! It's been such a great tool for me.

[showing how I use milanote]

If you're not familiar with Milanote, it's this visual tool designed for organizing ideas, projects, and inspiration. I use it mainly for gathering art references and creating vision boards, it's really versatile and fun to use!

Here's the board I shared with you guys. Feel free to explore it, I've added the link in the description below.
And here are some examples of my previous boards for sketchbook projects.
So basically, I drag photos around until I find a layout that works well together. this way I can avoid too much erasing when I transfer the ideas into my sketchbook. It really helps streamline the process. 

If you love organizing your workflow, making digital vision boards, or just want to keep your creative process smoother, you should definitely try Milanote. It’s free to start and has no time limits! You can find the link in the video description below. And if you try it out, let me know your thoughts in the comments!

Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.

Hey Curtis, 

The script looks really good, I am happy to go ahead with it!

I am so sorry to hear that the process has been frustrating for you and I apologise for that.  

Regarding the boards, I would just like to you show Milanote's boards nesting (boards within boards) feature, so you can definitely keep the existing board as is because it looks awesome & surely reflects all the effort you have put into it. All we would like you to do is simply add a sub-board to it. If you don't want to add more content to this sub-board, you could also just click into the sub-board and show the existing Milanote templates in your screen recording.

Now before we continue today’s pov around Paris
I’d like to say thank you to today's sponsor Milanote.

If you’re looking for a cool tool to organize your ideas and projects Whether you're a designer, writer, videographer , photographer or just someone bursting with creative ideas, Milnote is the way to go!

With its sleek interface and customizable templates, starting a new project is so easy with over 100 built in templates for every type of creative project you can effortlessly organize your thoughts and sketch out your vision giving you the freedom to explore different possibilities and unleash your creativity.

For my recent trip to Paris, I wanted to organize my photowalks in a visually interesting, creative and coherent manner. Rather than just referring to my notes or just looking at Inspo photos.

And this approach worked brilliantly, as I had my ideas organized in a clear visual manner that enabled me to hit the streets, visit the places I wanted to photograph and enabled me to be creative behind the camera. 

Milanote's visual boards are your creative playground, 
where you can gather inspiration, collect notes, images, videos, tasks and more. You have the freedom to arrange your ideas in a way that makes sense to you. The drag-and-drop functionality lets you move things around with ease, giving you the freedom to experiment and innovate without limitations.

Milanote isn't just about organizing your thoughts either, it's about collaboration too. Whether you're working solo or with a team, Milanote keeps everyone in sync with real-time updates, comments, and notifications. 

It's like having a virtual brainstorming session with your creative crew, no matter where they are.

So, if you're ready to take your creativity to the next level, Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project. 

Thanks Milanote for the sponsor now let’s get back to the POV.

I am gonna be honest this has frustrated me quite a bit. I am not here to make tons of storyboards and spend days of my own time creating this sorta of stuff. 
I have given Milanote the same amount of time I have given to all my clients.

I will look at this tomorrow for half-day if Milanote with what I can come-up but after that I have no time available until at latest end of next week. 
I have got other projects on and I also wanna get this video out next week, so you are not delaying my content to, which I do not appreciate.",,,true,true,"Hey Curtis,

For my recent trip to Paris, I wanted to organize my photowalks in a visually interesting, creative and coherent manner. Rather than just referring to my notes or just looking at Inspo photos.

And this approach worked brilliantly, as I had my ideas organized in a clear visual manner that enabled me to hit the streets, visit the places I wanted to photograph and enabled me to be creative behind the camera. 

Milanote's visual boards are your creative playground, 
where you can gather inspiration, collect notes, images, videos, tasks and more. You have the freedom to arrange your ideas in a way that makes sense to you. The drag-and-drop functionality lets you move things around with ease, giving you the freedom to experiment and innovate without limitations.

Milanote isn't just about organizing your thoughts either, it's about collaboration too. Whether you're working solo or with a team, Milanote keeps everyone in sync with real-time updates, comments, and notifications. 

It's like having a virtual brainstorming session with your creative crew, no matter where they are.

Thanks Milanote for the sponsor now let’s get back to the POV.

Message to Milanote team about Milanote boards: 

I am gonna be honest this has frustrated me quite a bit. I am not here to make tons of storyboards and spend days of my own time creating this sorta of stuff. 
I have given Milanote the same amount of time I have given to all my clients.

I will look at this tomorrow for half-day if Milanote with what I can come-up but after that I have no time available until at latest end of next week. 
I have got other projects on and I also wanna get this video out next week, so you are not delaying my content to, which I do not appreciate.",,,true,true,"Hey Curtis, 

The script looks really good, I am happy to go ahead with it!

I am so sorry to hear that the process has been frustrating for you and I apologise for that.  

Regarding the boards, I would just like to you show Milanote's boards nesting (boards within boards) feature, so you can definitely keep the existing board as is because it looks awesome & surely reflects all the effort you have put into it. All we would like you to do is simply add a sub-board to it. If you don't want to add more content to this sub-board, you could also just click into the sub-board and show the existing Milanote templates in your screen recording. 

Thanks again for all your work. 

Best,

Hey Curtis,

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! Excited to be collaborating with you. The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you would use Milanote to actually plan and organize your street photography project. 

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Hi Frieda, 

You have done a really good job with the video and using Milanote to explain the planning process of your project! I just had a couple of minor edits for you to make: 

- At the start, while introducing Milanote instead of showing the Milanote web page can you please show a screen recording of your finished boards (as we have found that showing the website does not add much value for the audience). 

- When you talk about the templates and are showing them on the screen, can you please say something along the lines of ""you can start with an empty board or use one of the many templates Milanote offers for a variety of different creative projects to get a head start into your project"". This will also help fill the empty 4-5 secs in the voiceover at that point. 

Thanks for all your work on this!

Hey Frieda, 

The script is absolutely perfect!! I love how you have brought forward Milanote's value so well by using the example of a physical cork board and how you have explained all the features so well by linking them to your project, making it sound like a very authentic integration. This is exactly what we look for - I am genuinely impressed!!

Just one very minor edit - when you mention the built in templates, could you please say something along the lines of ""Milanote makes it easy to start any type of creative project by offering over a 100 built-in templates"".

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on.   

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Additionally, it would be great if you could delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. This would help make the video more interactive and process focused. Also when you mention the built-in templates in your script, would be great if you could show a few built-in templates in the screen-recording at that point in the video and when you mention the commentary/collaboration function could you please show an example of someone you would share your boards with instead of generally mentioning the function. 

For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief. Can't wait to see your draft video soon!

Himika",,,4,"Here’s the script! The big text is what I want to say exactly like it’s written and the thin text are the main points I want to make while explaining my board. I hope it’s ok that way.

“Now we got our design, but between the first idea and the first cut lays a lot of planing that I usually don’t include in my videos, but today I want to take a closer look at those steps too and I’m really happy to introduce you to todays sponsor [Screen: Cut to Milanote Logo] Milanote- for it.”
[Screen: Milanote homepage] “Milanote is a tool to organise your projects and ideas and to support the most creative and effective workflow possible.”
[Screen: me :)] explaining my favourite things about Milanote:
“I’ve always looked for digital alternatives for moodboards that feel similar intuitive like the good old cork board. I’m a very visual person so I’d love to have one for every project, but I don’t have the space and there are a lot of things you can’t add to a traditional board.” [Screen: showing a traditional moodboard, maybe with a link printed out :)]
“So I got really exited when I got the opportunity to work with Milanote, because it’s exactly what I was looking for. So let me show you how I made my board for this project and my favourite features.”

[Screen: creating a new board] you can choose different templates for a board to help you get a starting point, but I sometimes like to start with a blank space 

[Screen: uploading the first picture] start by dragging in a new picture, then explaining that it’s the inspo for the project. Showing how to add a description to the picture

[Screen: showing the Milanote web clipper] adding more inspo pictures directly from Pinterest, explaining that with the web clipper they can be added easily to the board. Explaining the inspo (corset, flossing) at this step. [Screen: explaining heading and notes] 

[Screen: showing the relations between items] explaining the arrow feature 7 showing the writing on the screen.  Explaining the this makes the board very intuitive because you can write over everything & rearrange it as it suits you adding that you can make your boards more visually appealing by changing colours, icons or rearrange all of your items so that it suits your style. 
[Screen: writing is shown on the iPad] you can easily switch back and forth from the desktop to the app version which makes the use as intuitive and flexible as possible.

Now that we got the inspo down we can get more into the planing: 
I added all the fabrics I want to use to get everything together visually [Screen: showing other picture uploads]
When I decided on that I can now plan which materials I need [Screen: showing the todo list feature] I already got a few materials [Screen: checking them of] but I need to order others [Screen: adding links to the moodboard] 

After planning the design itself the next step is to plan how I want to work on it [Screen: creating a sub board with a week planed] for this I can create a sub board integrated to my moodboard. This time I chose a template which had a week plan and  could modify for myself. Here I could plan how much time I have for each step, and what I need to do beforehand 

[Screen: showing the commentary function] for things I wasn’t to sure about jet I used the commentary function. This is also an amazing feature if you plan a project together with someone else, or maybe a client, and you can use the board to communicate on. 
With the finished moodboard we are now perfectly prepared to start on our project.

Many thanks, Bella",,,4,"Planning is crucial for making the most out of your landscape photography, and tying all that information together is vital for using it efficiently.

This week's video is kindly sponsored by Milanote, and regular viewers might already know I’m a huge fan. I use Milanote daily, so let me show you how it helped me plan this wild camping photography trip in Snowdonia.
When I'm planning a photo shoot, I gather a ton of information and like to keep it all in one place. Milanote is fantastic for this because it lets you collect notes, photos, videos, tasks, and organize them in a way that makes sense. It’s truly a game-changer. 
For a trip like this, I need to bring lots of info together, like the hike I’ll be taking, sunrise and sunset times and local information. Milanote lets me access all of this info quickly, whether on my laptop or my phone.
Let's dive into the main board titled ""Wild Camp & Photo Shoot - Snowdonia."" Here, you’ll see an overview of the entire planned shoot. I've got checklists for the equipment I need so I can tick things off as I pack, useful information like maps, local weather, and my walking route. Anything created with a weblink can be clicked to go straight to the website, which is super handy for updates on traffic or weather.
I’ve also saved some photos I’ve previously shot in the area as reminders of what’s available. These are kept in a sub-board. Each of these icons is a new board, so if we click on this, we can see my photos that I might want to revisit if the conditions are favorable. This serves as inspiration and a helpful reminder when I’m there. You can create as many sub-boards as you like, which helps keep your project tidy and looking awesome.
I’ve got another sub-board dedicated to local facilities and amenities. I like to get creative with my boards by linking notes with arrows and color-coding them to make them visually appealing.
Another feature I love is the ability to share a board with someone else. If I’m meeting a friend for the trip, I can share the board, which is also super helpful as they can have access to the information that i have collected.
One of the best things about Milanote is how easy it is to use. I’ve built these boards myself, but they have over 100 built-in templates to get you started. Milanote is available for free with no time limit, so if you want to be super organized on your next photography trip, check out the link in the description to get started with Milanote.",,,true,true,"Hey Ian, wow, such a detailed script - really appreciate all the work you put into this.

Just one thought - I realised by looking at your draft video that you might be planning on putting this Milanote segment at the end of your main video. Could you please move that to somewhere in between your video, if possible so that we can optimize performance on the integration.

Hey Trond,

Happy to go ahead with this as long as you please include that "" Milanote is a tool for planning creative projects"" and make sure that you interact with your boards to explain to your audience how you use the various Milanote features for planning. 

Here are some tips to help you create a great screen recording:
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Also remember to go back to the Creative Brief for further reference. 

Looking forward to seeing your draft video soon!

Hey Trond, 

The script is fantastic, you have done a great job explaining Milanote's value and linking it to your own project!! I am just worried that this might not enough for a 5 minute segment. Here are some suggestions: 

- Where you introduce Milanote can you please add Milanote is a planning program 'for creative projects'.......
- I would really like you to describe to your audience the various features Milanote has and how you used them in your project (instead of just listing them) while you interact with your boards. For example, talk about how the to-do lists helps you keep track of your tasks, show your locations board to show the board-nesting (boards within boards) feature etc. 
- You could also talk about how Milanote allows you to share and collaborate on projects. You can give an example of someone you like to maybe get feedback from or a colleague you like to share your work with
- I also think showing the web-clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) will be a great fit for your project. You could briefly show you might use it to directly add inspiration images to your board. 

These are just suggestions to help you give enough to talk through the 5 minute integration. Feel free to use the ones that suit your creative vision. 

Looking forward to seeing the updated script and thanks for your great work so far!!

Best, 
Himika

Hey Trond,

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea - I am happy to move forward with it! 

We can maybe look towards workshopping the video title to make it more photography related. Also, just a quick thought - would love if the integration could focus more on using Milanote to organize a particular photography project of yours rather than a general project organization. I think that would help it be more natural and make it sound less like a tutorial. 

The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards. 

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.

Also, here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Hey Jessica, 
Thanks for putting this detailed script together - it sounds great! 
A helpful guideline for the draft segment recording is the 80/20 rule: aim for 80% board screen recording and 20% b-roll shots. 
Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon (:

[Screen: Cut to Milanote Logo] **“This video is sponsored by Milanote”
Advert:
Are you a visual planner? Do you love moodboards?
[Jessica slowly being overcome by tiny pieces of paper] Do you love to put all of your creative ideas onto little scraps of paper with the intention of pinning them on the wall like you’re in a detective movie but then find you actually loose them because they’re flapping around everywhere and it ends up being an uncoordinated mess that takes way more time than it should...?
WELL, I have just the thing for you!
[Screen: **Show Milanote - the desktop version] I’ve always been a big fan of visual mood boards and finding Milanote was like... finding a shoe that is the perfect fit.
I’ve been using it for a number of months now so I was overjoyed when they reached out to sponsor today’s video. [Screen: Cut to Milanote Logo]
[Screen: Show your project board] Milanote is the perfect tool for organising creative projects. It’s an online canvas that allows you to brainstorm, plan, sketch, list, dump all of your brilliant and wild ideas into one place.
I personally really like how easy it is to use as a collaborative, visual tool- especially since my editor actually lives in Spain. Hi, Clara!
[Screen: Add elements to your board] I find that I focus best on writing and researching videos when I’ve mapped everything out visually beforehand. How am I getting from point A to point B? Well with Milanote’s various tools I can streamline and organise my filmmaking process incredibly easily.
BUT!
That’s not all I use it for... and you don’t have to feel overwhelmed thinking that you’re not a very visually creative person (hey now, I felt that self doubt, back it up!) because Milanote not only can be used for a range of different projects- We organised our gallery wall using it!
     
 [Screen: Show built-in template picker] - but it has some great built-in templates to get you started.
There are over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project; [Screen: Show relevant templates] from a weekly planner to a craft project timeline; from a wedding moodboard to an Eisenhower Matrix to keep you feeling productive. I’m currently building a new website and found that template was so helpful to get me started rather than staring at a blank canvas and feeling overwhelmed.
[Screen: Show your board] I actually used the Content Creation Video Plan template to get me started on this video! I’m not kidding, I use Milanote to plan and organise all of my creative projects.
[Screen: Interact with the board] I like to have the board start at a main, jumping off point- I’ve put the main theme of the video over here, a short explanation of breeching at the bottom... but mainly I found myself most inspired by these paintings of young boys (look at adorable little Prince Ulrik) juxtaposed with harsh comments left on modern TikTok videos of boys wearing dresses. As if this is some incredibly new phenomena and not... the norm for much of history.
I also have ‘research’ area of the board, where I’ve collated some useful links and book sources. And then a ‘content’ area where things that are used more directly in the video are kept, including colours, quotes and photos that I found particularly fitting to the point.
I can easily add notes, drag and drop images, insert video and audio clips and the best part is that it automatically converts links into thumbnails so you don’t ever need to download things.
[Screen: Add comment to board] Whether you’re a writer, interior designer, filmmaker, student or just a very visual person, Milanote is designed to help you organise your work and share it with others easily. You can invite your colleagues, friends, or students to view the project and collaborate with them in real-time.

Hey Chloe, thanks for sharing your script! This sounds wonderful! Here are a few suggestions: 
- To introduce Milanote, it would be great to give your audience a quick summary of what Milanote is - ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects""
- I love how much detail you went into your project. It would be good to have a few references of how certain features i.e. Milanote tables card could be useful for jotting down your measurements, or how you use Milanote card links to save product links etc. So explaining how you use Milanote to help with aspects of your project throughout would be fantastic.
- Lastly, it would be great to showcase some Milanote templates i.e. Whether you're an interior designer or renovator, Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. For example, I used the  _____ template to plan  _____” 
You're welcome to start drafting your video! Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creator Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s  For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon!

",,,4,"introduction:
hi everyone in today’s video I am going to makeover my living room. There is this space on one side of my living room where I’ve been laying books against the wall in order to hide the Wi-Fi router and today’s the day where I am redesigning this and making over this space .

How? Milanote prep:
In order to carry through this project I decided to structure it into different sections and for that I use the app Milanote to create a before and after like an overview of the floor plan and the area I’m working with I created a mood board where I picked photos and references online that I had for that space and the mood that I wanted to go for. it helped me have a visual reference of what I was going to create and it’s easy to just drag and drop photos or links to any Milanote board. and lastly, I created a wishlist/product list of products and items that I wanted to purchase along with some of the items and decor pieces I already owned to see how all of them would fit together. On Milanote I was able to add to-dos, reminder notes, arrows and colors to visually depict what I was envisioning in my head. It helped giving me a visual idea of what would actually look like to have all of the pieces together along with remembering all the details I thought about. We have so many ideas and whenever I don't write them down, then I forget about them so Milanote was a life-saver for this project but also many others I've planned on the app. You can use Milanote on your next project by using the link that is in the description. 
Finally I simply had to order the pieces from the wishlist and wait for them to arrive.
(Include footage of delivery)

Execution / decoration phase:
I started by removing the books and the area and cleaning up that space. I also removed the frame that was hanging on the wall so I was able to work on a blank slate. It took some time for me to unpack and build the sideboard, I chose a wooden one to add warmth to my space as most of the living room is grey and cream. It was pretty easy to do it alone so I was able to complete it within the same afternoon and then when it was ready, I put it against the wall and it suited that little space there so perfectly. I had taken the measurements before and it really fitted that area nicely and it actually created more space and more dimension to the whole living room and made it all feel more homy and cozy. I also wanted to add a side lamp as I only have one standing lamp in my living room and ceiling lights. I like some ambience lamps especially for the evening or early early mornings so I got this really beautiful lampshade and I thought it really worked with some of the other pieces that I had in the living room such as the black and beige TV stand. I stacked some of my favorite magazines and books along with a hemp create piece my friend from Estonia makes by hand, I also added a plant on the left side left holder that against the wall and I decided to keep it like this for now.


conclusion
so that’s it for my living room makeover I’m very happy with how it came out. i’m the type of person who likes to go ahead and just do the thing, but by planning ahead of time and taking measurements and doing all of the preparation work to this project it came out really really nice where as and I didn’t end up with anything that wasn’t fitting the space. The execution phase went out so much more smoothly and I loved using Milanote to prep this project. The last thing I might change is adding a new frame or mirror above, let me know what you think and what you’d do in the comments. Thank you for being here and spending this moment with me.

It was pretty easy to do it alone so I was able to complete it within the same afternoon and then when it was ready, I put it against the wall and it suited that little space there so perfectly. I had taken the measurements before and it really fitted that area nicely and it actually created more space and more dimension to the whole living room and made it all feel more homy and cozy. I also wanted to add a side lamp as I only have one standing lamp in my living room and ceiling lights. I like some ambience lamps especially for the evening or early early mornings so I got this really beautiful lampshade and I thought it really worked with some of the other pieces that I had in the living room such as the black and beige TV stand. I stacked some of my favorite magazines and books along with a hemp create piece my friend from Estonia makes by hand, I also added a plant on the left side left holder that against the wall and I decided to keep it like this for now.


conclusion
so that’s it for my living room makeover I’m very happy with how it came out. i’m the type of person who likes to go ahead and just do the thing, but by planning ahead of time and taking measurements and doing all of the preparation work to this project it came out really really nice where as and I didn’t end up with anything that wasn’t fitting the space. The execution phase went out so much more smoothly and I loved using Milanote to prep this project. The last thing I might change is adding a new frame or mirror above, let me know what you think and what you’d do in the comments. Thank you for being here and spending this moment with me. I had so much fun spending this moment together and doing this project. I’ll see you all next week.",,,true,true,"Hey Chloe, thanks for sharing your script! This sounds wonderful! Here are a few suggestions: 
- To introduce Milanote, it would be great to give your audience a quick summary of what Milanote is - ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects""
- I love how much detail you went into your project. It would be good to have a few references of how certain features i.e. Milanote tables card could be useful for jotting down your measurements, or how you use Milanote card links to save product links etc. So explaining how you use Milanote to help with aspects of your project throughout would be fantastic.

You're welcome to start drafting your video! Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creator Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s  For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon!

hi everyone in today’s video I am going to makeover my living room. There is this space on one side of my living room where I’ve been laying books against the wall in order to hide the Wi-Fi router and today’s the day where I am redesigning this and making over this space .

How? Milanote prep:
In order to carry through this project I decided to structure it into different sections and for that I use the app Milanote to create a before and after like an overview of the floor plan and the area I’m working with I created a mood board where I picked photos and references online that I had for that space and the mood that I wanted to go for. it helped me have a visual reference of what I was going to create and it’s easy to just drag and drop photos or links to any Milanote board. and lastly, I created a wishlist/product list of products and items that I wanted to purchase along with some of the items and decor pieces I already owned to see how all of them would fit together. On Milanote I was able to add to-dos, reminder notes, arrows and colors to visually depict what I was envisioning in my head. It helped giving me a visual idea of what would actually look like to have all of the pieces together along with remembering all the details I thought about. We have so many ideas and whenever I don't write them down, then I forget about them so Milanote was a life-saver for this project but also many others I've planned on the app. You can use Milanote on your next project by using the link that is in the description. 
Finally I simply had to order the pieces from the wishlist and wait for them to arrive.
(Include footage of delivery)

Execution / decoration phase:
I started by removing the books and the area and cleaning up that space. I also removed the frame that was hanging on the wall so I was able to work on a blank slate. It took some time for me to unpack and build the sideboard, I chose a wooden one to add warmth to my space as most of the living room is grey and cream. It was pretty easy to do it alone so I was able to complete it within the same afternoon and then when it was ready, I put it against the wall and it suited that little space there so perfectly.

Hey Cari,

I’m really excited to collaborate with you on this upcoming project! Thanks for sharing your project idea. Just a quick note: we usually steer clear of holiday trip planning since we focus on organizing creative projects. Is it possible to showcase how you plan a creative writing project instead?

Also, I recommend demonstrating Milanote on the web app rather than the mobile version, as it’s better optimized for desktop use. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Hey Hanacue,

The script looks great!! You have done an amazing job bringing forward Milanote's value, explaining the different features and linking them to your personal work. Just a small edit - could you please give a specific example of who like to collaborate with on the boards instead just generally saying colleagues. 

Other than this minor addition, happy to approve the script. Feel free to get started on your draft video. 

Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Himika",,,4,"[Introduce Milanote] Milanote is so graciously sponsoring today’s video; and, for the last 3 months, I have been genuinely using it for all my art projects. Milanote is an organizational tool where you can plan your creative projects in a flexible workspace. I’m someone who is miserable with packed schedules, and calendars. As soon as I see a ton of words and dates, I don’t even wanna look at it. For me, having a lot of visual guidance is important for keeping my creativity flowing. Luckily, Milanote has been a great way for me to fully customize my boards to my liking.
[Show Main Board] I’ve made this main board for my current VTuber project that you’re watching, and as you can see I’ve organized it completely visually by creating sub-boards for each part that I need to focus on when I need to work on it.
[Show Sub-Board] Since the model is typically broken down into body parts, I can simply click on the head when I’m working on it, and zone in on areas like the eyes or the mouth, with exact guides, references, and inspiration to get my mind going. And I mean come on, I love looking at this, it is so visual and comprehensive that it tickles my brain in just the right ways.
[Demonstrate features] If you’re not sure how to start, you can simply select a template for your board, then add things like arrows, comments, images, videos, and more. 
[Milanote Web Clipper] As an artist, I need to save tons of references and keep them all in a place I can actually find. So the Milanote Web Clipper is perfect for saving images and links directly to the board.
[Collaboration] Collaborating couldn’t be easier. I just simply share my board with my colleagues and they give me feedback and comments in real-time.

Hey Bella, the script I mentioned earlier was the integration plan for Milanote. I have now implemented those parts into the entire video to ensure it flows well and makes sense. This will also discourage viewers from skipping the video, especially when the content is related to the sponsor.

The Milanote parts are highlighted in light blue. Let me know what you think and I will proceed with the video recording.

Thank you,
Nuno


Hi Bella,

Here's the link to access the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVDwjEwJo4mBVRnMj8isR6T8GHmOQN-g/view?usp=sharing

I spoke about Milanote several times in the video, but you can find it on these timestamps:

00:14 - 00:25 Here I'm showing some parts of my boards, without mentioning Milanote yet. The idea is not to let people drop off right at the beginning of the video.

05:00 - 07:05 The main Milanote integration

08:30 - 08:35

10:24 - 11:32 Here I'm showing my subboard with material references

13:48 - 14:04 I'm showing here a subboard with imperfection image references

Let me know what you think! I can publish it tomorrow, Wednesday, or Thursday.

Thank you!

Hey Bella, the script I mentioned earlier was the integration plan for Milanote. I have now implemented those parts into the entire video to ensure it flows well and makes sense. This will also discourage viewers from skipping the video, especially when the content is related to the sponsor.

Hi Nuno,

Thank you for sharing your draft video. Overall, I think it looks really good! My only suggestion before you go live is to replace the screen recording of the Milanote homepage with one showing some built-in templates, for example. We find that showcasing Milanote's templates adds more value to the mention.

Please let me know once the revised video is ready!

Thanks,

Blanca

Hey Charlie,

Thanks for sharing your script with me, you have done a great job -it looks absolutely amazing!! Just wanted to point out a couple edits: 

- When you introduce Milanote, can you specify that ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects"" as the audience who are new to your channel might not be familiar with it. 
- Could you please also talk about the built-in templates and say something along the lines of ""Milanote offers a wide range of customizable templates for a variety of different creative projects"" and show a couple templates in the screen recording at this point please.
- When you talk about collaborating on a board, would it be possible to give a specific example of someone you might share your boards with for collaboration or feedback? If not, then you can leave that part as is :)

Other than these minor edits, feel free to get started on your draft video for the segment. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
 - Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
 - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your home board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
 - Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
 - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!! 

Best, 
Himika
",,,4,"[I made need to cut this down a bit, as it's running a little over 90 seconds at the moment]

Let's start at the very beginning, step 1: the planning. And you'll also know if you saw my previous renovations on this room, that my favorite tool for planning out my house overhauls is Milanote. What extreme luck that they're the sponsor of today's video, right?

TRANSITION TO INTEGRATION

Frequent viewers may recall that when we first got this house, I was very overwhelmed by the numerous spaces that could be overhauled and the even more numerous ideas I have for possible overhauling. I was so relieved when Milanote reached out at the start of my home renovation journey to introduce me to their amazing system for organizing your creativity brain tornado. 

My studio board was a great place to gather all the inspiration for this room, and now it's time to make a new sub-board for the closets.

Now as much as I love the blue, green, purple color palette of the studio, I also adore a bit of hidden color, and since the closet doors are typically closed, it's the perfect place to throw in a surprise rainbow! I dug around for some rainbow inspiration, since I don't want just a basic primary color palette. Love this out-of-normal-order style, as well as using pink instead of red. I can use the color samples with the eyedropper function to select my favorite shades from the inspiration palettes and mix them together into the perfect rainbow for me!

I also need to find some info on uh… how to build shelves, specifically the L-shaped shelves I'm hoping for here, which have that tricky corner to support. The Milanote web clipper lets me easily save articles, products, and tutorials straight to my board without even leaving the page.

This got me thinking I need some fabric storage and organization inspiration, so I made a sub-board for the articles and images I found that provide interesting options for both yardage and cabbage - I love these color coordinated candy jars so much. 

When you've got a project that seems overwhelming, maybe you just keep putting it off and off and off, starting out with a Milanote board can be a great way to gather your thoughts, get them out of your head, and organize them into a manageable, visible bit of inspiration. All your links, images, notes, and to do lists are right there in the same place, and you can even share your board with a collaborator: a friend taking on the same project, coworkers on a job, a partner you're wrangling into helping you…

And you know my favorite thing about Milanote? It's available for free, with no time limit, so creative organization is right there at your fingertips. Sign up for free with the link in my description and start organizing that inspiration!

Big thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video, and uh… What's step 2?

TRANSITION BACK TO VIDEO",,,true,true,"Hey Charlie,

Thanks for sharing your script with me, you have done a great job -it looks absolutely amazing!! Just wanted to point out a couple edits: 

- When you introduce Milanote, can you specify that ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects"" as the audience who are new to your channel might not be familiar with it. 
- Could you please also talk about the built-in templates and say something along the lines of ""Milanote offers a wide range of customizable templates for a variety of different creative projects"" and show a couple templates in the screen recording at this point please.
- When you talk about collaborating on a board, would it be possible to give a specific example of someone you might share your boards with for collaboration or feedback? If not, then you can leave that part as is :)

Other than these minor edits, feel free to get started on your draft video for the segment. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
 - Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
 - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your home board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
 - Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
 - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!! 

Best,

Let's start at the very beginning, step 1: the planning. And you'll also know if you saw my previous renovations on this room, that my favorite tool for planning out my house overhauls is Milanote. What extreme luck that they're the sponsor of today's video, right?

TRANSITION TO INTEGRATION

Frequent viewers may recall that when we first got this house, I was very overwhelmed by the numerous spaces that could be overhauled and the even more numerous ideas I have for possible overhauling. I was so relieved when Milanote reached out at the start of my home renovation journey to introduce me to their amazing system for organizing your creativity brain tornado. 

My studio board was a great place to gather all the inspiration for this room, and now it's time to make a new sub-board for the closets.

Now as much as I love the blue, green, purple color palette of the studio, I also adore a bit of hidden color, and since the closet doors are typically closed, it's the perfect place to throw in a surprise rainbow! I dug around for some rainbow inspiration, since I don't want just a basic primary color palette. Love this out-of-normal-order style, as well as using pink instead of red. I can use the color samples with the eyedropper function to select my favorite shades from the inspiration palettes and mix them together into the perfect rainbow for me!

I also need to find some info on uh… how to build shelves, specifically the L-shaped shelves I'm hoping for here, which have that tricky corner to support. The Milanote web clipper lets me easily save articles, products, and tutorials straight to my board without even leaving the page.

This got me thinking I need some fabric storage and organization inspiration, so I made a sub-board for the articles and images I found that provide interesting options for both yardage and cabbage - I love these color coordinated candy jars so much. 

When you've got a project that seems overwhelming, maybe you just keep putting it off and off and off, starting out with a Milanote board can be a great way to gather your thoughts, get them out of your head, and organize them into a manageable, visible bit of inspiration. All your links, images, notes, and to do lists are right there in the same place, and you can even share your board with a collaborator: a friend taking on the same project, coworkers on a job, a partner you're wrangling into helping you…

Hey yaejiyea,

The script looks amazing! Really really great work with bringing out Milanote's value and keeping it so authentic. 

 I am happy for you to record your draft video for this. Here are some reminders on screen-recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I can't wait to see this come to life soon!!

[Screen: Milanote logo] “Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.” 

[Screen: Yarn Holder Purse Board] “Currently, I’m using Milanote to develop and design this purse idea. In this board, I can organize all of my inspiration pictures - I felt inspired by these adorable crocheted Miu Miu purses for the general design of the bag. I also included an inspiration photo of my favorite yarn bowl that I own, and this is going to inform my design choices for the yarn opening in the bag.  ”

[Screen: Add photo of a gauge swatch to main board] “It’s perfect for crocheters, crochet pattern designers, and visual thinkers like myself, because it allows you to organize your ideas visually and keep notes of your stitches, materials, and inspo from online. It’s really convenient to be able to see all of my sketches, inspiration pictures, notes, tasks to complete, and gauge swatches all in one place. That way, I can keep notes of each gauge swatch and contrast and compare them really quite easily. I often find myself referring back to my notes, swatches, and inspiration photos using their mobile app on my phone when I’m in the middle of a project. It can be super helpful to be able to reference what the final design should look like when you’re in the middle of row 30 and losing steam to finish that crochet project.” 

[Screen: Click into Moodboard] “This is my moodboard for the overall design of the purse. As you can see, I can visually organize my plans of making a yarn bag organizer, but making it cute so I’ll want to wear the purse as a fashionable accessory styled in my everyday outfits while maintaining utility so I can crochet on the go.”

[Screen: Interact with elements in moodboard] “As I plan out my project, using Milanote also allows me to organize my thoughts on how I want to go about incorporating the technical details to create the utility I want out of this purse. Personally, I find it really inconvenient when yarn bowls/ bags only have a grommet for the yarn, so instead I was able to find some inspiration photos of yarn openings that will have greater utility for my personal preference .”
 
[Screen: Save image of Miu Miu purse using Web Clipper] “One of my favorite features from Milanote is their Web Clipper. The Web Clipper is a really handy extension that allows you to save images from various places online when gathering and organizing your notes. This makes saving images, videos, and links directly to my boards super quick and easy.” 

[Screen: Show built-in template picker] “Whether you're a designer or a creative in general, Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. For example, I used the Fashion Project Plan Template to plan the designing and crocheting of this purse.”

Hey Milly, 

Great work on the video!! I am happy to approve this. However, I have one small edit request. 

As mentioned in your script, could you please talk about the built-in templates very briefly (Just say ""If you are wanting to start a new Milanote board or project, Milanote make it super easy for beginners with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project"" and click into a couple of templates in the screen recording at this point in the video). No need to go into detail. 

If you feel like including this might make your integration run longer than 5 minutes, feel free to cut off a small bit from the existing video to your liking :)

Hey Milly,
The script is absolutely perfect - I am genuinely impressed!! I love how you have brought forward Milanote's value so well and how you plan on interacting with your boards to show  all the features by linking them to your project. This is exactly what we look for - such an authentic way to integrate Milanote :)

Just one minor suggestion - would also love for you to talk about the Milanote web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) when you talk about your moodbaord and show how you can use it to directly add references to your board. 

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on. 
Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Additionally, it would be great if you could delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 

For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief. Can't wait to see your draft video soon!

[Interact with sub-boards and showcase adding different elements to the board such as notes, images, colours, tasks and more whilst talking over this].

[Screen-recording of Milanote templates page] - “If you are wanting to start a new Milanote board or project, Milanote make it super easy for beginners with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. Let’s take a look at some of them…”

[Screen cuts back to me] - “As you can see, Milanote is such an amazing, easily accessible took for organising your creative projects, and it is completely free to use with no time-limit.”

“Sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description to start your next creative project!”",,,true,true,"Hey Milly,
The script is absolutely perfect - I am genuinely impressed!! I love how you have brought forward Milanote's value so well and how you plan on interacting with your boards to show  all the features by linking them to your project. This is exactly what we look for - such an authentic way to integrate Milanote :)

Just one minor suggestion - would also love for you to talk about the Milanote web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome) when you talk about your moodbaord and show how you can use it to directly add references to your board. 

Feel free to get started with your draft video from here on. 
Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Additionally, it would be great if you could delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 

For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief. Can't wait to see your draft video soon!

Hey Milly, 

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly - this sounds perfect! I am happy to move forward with it :)

The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you use Milanote to organize the small business launch that you talked about.

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.

Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link).

Hey Milly,

Thank you so much for sharing your video project idea Just a quick thought, would it be possible for you to integrate Milanote in a video where you talk about your small business instead of just the collection and show your audience how you would use Milanote to plan/organise/conceptualise your small business as a whole. 

I am attaching a similar collaboration we did with Monica Razak to give you a better idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgU412T_Z3M&t=205s

Let me know if this was possible. If not, I am happy to proceed with your original video idea :)

Lately I’ve been trying to get better at drawing hands, feet, and the rest of the other interesting body parts of the human figure, and the quest for finding endless references and organising them in one place has had me scratching my brain mindlessly for hours until I started using milanote, the sponsor of today’s video. Milanote is an interactive tool that helps you organize all the different files for your CREATIVE projects on one platform so accessing them can be easier. Milanote allows you to collect pictures, videos, notes and text, and arrange them into different boards using any template that suits your specific needs. You can also create several tasks for different things you want to study, and tick them when you’re done. I like to use milanote when working on any project to keep things organised. I start by creating a general board where I layout a broad overview that covers everything concerning the project I’m about to work on. then I move on to place my references in a sub board and keep specific things I want to practice in a separate board so I know where to find each of them. I like to use milanote’s web clipper tool when gathering screenshots from other artists that draw in a style I admire, and then save every image or screenshot I find useful In the board. 
 This also works well when you’re collaborating with other artists and working on the same project, so everyone has a good understanding of what the project is about and has access to the same references all at once since everything is properly organized in the same place.
The kind folks at milanote are giving free access with no time limit to everyone who signs up for a free account using the link in the description. So head over to https://milanote.com/mohammedagbadi to try it out for free with no time limit.

The kind folks at milanote are giving free access with no time limit to everyone who signs up for a free account using the link in the description. So head over to https://milanote.com/mohammedagbadi to try it out for free with no time limit. All the links will be in the description, and thank you to milanote for sponsoring this video.",,,true,true,"Hey Mohammed, 

Thanks for getting this to me so quickly. You have done an amazing job explaining Milanote's value and its features and I am happy to approve this. Just a couple pointers:

- Would it be possible for you to remove the first line ""now let me tell you briefly about the sponsor......"" since you already mention that Milanote is sponsoring this video twice later in the script and it might disrupt the natural flow of your video. 

- Could you please briefly mention something about the colour swatches and how you can pick colours using the eyedropper. 

- It would be great if you could briefly talk about the built-in templates (something along the lines of ""If you don't know where to start, Milanote offers over a 100 built-in templates to make it easy to start any creative project"") and show a 1-2 templates on the screen at this point. 

- Was it possible to give a specific example of someone you like to collaborate with or get feedback from. 

Feel free to start your draft video from here. Again some reminders on getting great screen recordings: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon!!

I do understand your point when you say that including the part where you speak to professional anime creators is important but we have found that showing instead of telling creates more value. Having said that, you can briefly include a line or two about professional anime work since that is your core audience. 

Also a small edit - when you talk about copying and pasting images can you please refer to the web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome)

they actually sponsor today's video, but I also use them for my personal projects for years now.
Working like this is just a lot more appealing to me than having some random folder on my desktop with loose reference images.
Being able organize and especially make annotations like this is priceless.

I have an own link to this tool down below, you can use MilaNote with no time limit AND for FREE  if you sign up by using that.
And also, you support me by using the link - 

I'm using it for collecting hairstyles references here but milanote's a great tool to organize ANY creative project since it has over 100 templates to use you to use.

 I'm also using this tool to collect ideas like outfits for the characters, locations for the scenes that I want to draw for my manga etc.

And yeah, there are some built-in tutorials that explain all of these features but I think it's all pretty self explainatory since most of these features are simple drag-and-drop like adding 
new notes. You've got a drawing feature for drawing on THE ACTUAL board which helpful if you like to work visually like I do, if you're designing multiple characters or projects you
can just drag out a new board - and boom. A whole new board that even includes sample pictures if you're picking a template for it.
You can even copy- and paste things in that you find online, thats also super helpful.

I completely understand your vision with but we would still like you to talk about the features especially for audience who might be getting introduced to Milanote for the first time through your video. 

If you think that you have limited time, I recommend deleting this part below since we would like you to focus on the current project you are working on:

""I also told you about this the last time, but
I've animated a commercial for a fashion brand and it's also super helpful to have tools like these in order to have all of your references ready
and organized.
Also, obviously, my client was VERY pleased when seeing this, so he knew that his project was in good hands.
Actual animation studios also use tools like these in order to organize their anime projects""

(professionally producing anime), which is basically THE biggest
incentive to download it in favor for features that
are completely self explainatory and need no introduction at all.
This is completely your decision and I do not want to be held
accountable if this affects performance of the campaign in any way.

---------
*WAIT - what's that software you're using???*

Well, what I'm using right here is called MilaNote, you might already know this software if you watch my videos regularly.
they actually sponsor today's video, but I also use them for my personal projects for years now.
Working like this is just a lot more appealing to me than having some random folder on my desktop with loose reference images.
Being able organize and especially make annotations like this is priceless.

I have an own link to this tool down below, you can use MilaNote with no time limit AND for FREE  if you sign up by using that.
And also, you support me by using the link - 

I'm using it for collecting hairstyles references here but milanote's a great tool to organize ANY creative project since it has over 100 templates to use you to use.

 I'm also using this tool to collect ideas like outfits for the characters, locations for the scenes that I want to draw for my manga etc.

And yeah, there are some built-in tutorials that explain all of these features but I think it's all pretty self explainatory since most of these features are simple drag-and-drop like adding 
new notes. You've got a drawing feature for drawing on THE ACTUAL board which helpful if you like to work visually like I do, if you're designing multiple characters or projects you
can just drag out a new board - and boom. A whole new board that even includes sample pictures if you're picking a template for it.
You can even copy- and paste things in that you find online, thats also super helpful.


And like I said, it's all free and without a time limit with my link that's down below.
Thanks for milanote for sponsoring - and thank you guys for sitting through the ad!",,,true,true,"Hey Draw Like a Sir, 

I do understand your point when you say that including the part where you speak to professional anime creators is important but we have found that showing instead of telling creates more value. Having said that, you can briefly include a line or two about professional anime work since that is your core audience. 

Also a small edit - when you talk about copying and pasting images can you please refer to the web clipper tool (https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/1015930-milanote-web-clipper-for-chrome)

Feel free to get started on your draft video from here on. Though you might be already familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording:
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your hard work so far!! 

Best, 
Himika ",

Hey Callimara, 

Thank you so much for putting in so much hard work into this video - it looks absolutely amazing!!
 
I just had one minor edit I'd like you to make. When you introduce Milanote (saying ""but that's when Milanote came in"") could you please display our animated logo which you will be able to find in the Creative Brief. Also instead of displaying the website, it would be great if you could jump straight into displaying your boards because we have found that showing the website does not add much value (maybe you can show some built-in templates here; e.g when you are talking about moodbaords show the moodboard template etc.)

Again, thank you for all your beautiful work and I look forward to seeing an edited version of the video soon :))

Hey Callimara,

Thanks for making the edits, happy to go ahead with these - it would be really great if you could mention at least just one more feature somewhere in the video where you think you can (I would highly suggest showing the web clipper tool quickly to show how you easily can add images to the board using it). 

Other than that, I am happy for you to get started on your draft video. 

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Update: Added this to the dedicated shoutout segment, and I have replied to the comments you left on the doc as well! I can't really include most of it in the script as it will be in the screen recording of my presentation.

""So, because the Jack Frost x Elsa ship requires paragraphs of context and at least 5 layers of lore on top of that to fully understand how it would work, let alone explain it, it felt like an incredibly daunting task because I wasn’t really sure how I would organize all of it short of being on camera with an actual corkboard looking like THIS, but most importantly, I didn’t even know what my actual goal for the video was, and how I would format the video around it.

And that’s the main reason why this script and this idea to rewrite Frozen 2 into a Frozen/Rise of the Guardians crossover was dropped in the first place. But that’s when Milanote came in, which is a tool that helps you organize ideas, compile inspiration like a moodboard, and list tasks you need to do, all in one, digital corkboard. That was the missing link I needed for this video idea.

Milanote actually made it a lot easier for me to keep all my references together and allows me to arrange it in a way that visually makes sense to me (you’ll see me downright abusing the arrows because what is a consipiracy board without a lot of connecting threads) which helps me keep my ideas and the associated references and evidence together. 

Initially, I really wanted to have everything, all the concepts and points, on the main board to create this incredibly massive, sprawling mindmap, but it began to melt my computer, and to crash anyone else’s computer when they click on this board, so Milanote’s sub-board feature really comes in handy here because it let me move those huge branches onto its own board—which we will be diving into as well—and overall made the main board more organized.
Therefore, unlike most of my videos, we will be spending our time here, on my ultimate Rise of the Guardians x Frozen crossover Milanote board.

And if you’re watching this video now, that means I managed to complete my unhinged board, and I’d like to share my work! I have an invitation link in my description so you guys can check it out, add more notes, ideas, fanart, expand on the story, whatever! 

Also, if you’re thinking of doing something like this, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit or if you enjoy using Milanote, let me know down below in the comments!
So thank you Milanote for sponsoring this video because it literally wouldn’t have seen the light of day without you. Also shoutout to my good buddy Mali-Malware for supplementing the book lore that is literally impossible to find online and helping me out with some of my story ideas.""",,,true,true,"Hey Callimara,

Hey Callimara,

The script looks fun and you have done a great job explaining what Milanote is and its value to your audience. However, my concern is that though as you mentioned your Milanote boards will be in the background of most of your video, you do not reference any of Milanote's features (e.g. boards within boards, images, notes, the ability to draw/handwrite o boards) anywhere while going through your boards. 

It would be great if you could please revise the script a bit to talk to your audience about these features throughout the video as you go through boards. It would be helpful to have a look at the Creative Brief to understand how to talk about each feature :)

Initially, I really wanted to have everything, all the concepts and points, on the main board to create this incredibly massive, sprawling mindmap, but it began to melt my computer, and to crash anyone else’s computer when they click on this board, so Milanote’s sub-board feature really comes in handy here because it let me move those huge branches onto its own board—which we will be diving into as well—and overall made the main board more organized.
Therefore, unlike most of my videos, we will be spending our time here, on my ultimate Rise of the Guardians x Frozen crossover Milanote board.

And if you’re watching this video now, that means I managed to complete my unhinged board, and I’d like to share my work! I have an invitation link in my description so you guys can check it out, add more notes, ideas, fanart, expand on the story, whatever! 

Also, if you’re thinking of doing something like this, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit or if you enjoy using Milanote, let me know down below in the comments!
So thank you Milanote for sponsoring this video because it literally wouldn’t have seen the light of day without you. Also shoutout to my good buddy Mali-Malware for supplementing the book lore that is literally impossible to find online and helping me out with some of my story ideas.""",,,true,true,"Hey Callimara,

Thanks for making the edits, happy to go ahead with these - it would be really great if you could mention at least just one more feature somewhere in the video where you think you can (I would highly suggest showing the web clipper tool quickly to show how you easily can add images to the board using it). 

Other than that, I am happy for you to get started on your draft video. 

Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

For more helpful insights, again be sure to check out the Creative Brief. Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box https://milanote.com/callimara).

Hey Callimara,
Thanks so much for clarifying project idea—this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it. Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Hey Biata, 

Would have been great to get the boards and script approved before moving on to actually making the draft video. That's the process we usually follow. But because the boards are looking good and the Milanote features are clear in the script I am happy to let you skip those steps this time around, given that some minor changes can be made to the video: 

1. when you introduce Milanote can you please add the animated logo on the screen (you can find this in the brief linked above)

2. in the intro can you please add this line ""Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects"" so that the audience get an overview of what the app is about right from the start. 

3. before getting into actually showing how you use Milanote, please outline what project you are using it to plan 

4. Please also try to show more of the desktop version of your Milanote boards on the screen as you talk through the integration

Please refer to the Creative Brief for video examples to illustrate this better. Looking forward to a revised version of the draft video.

Apologies for the delay in responding - this email landed in my spam folder. I’ve had a chance to review the video, and unfortunately, it will need to be revised.

The video currently runs for 60 seconds, but our agreement was for 90 seconds. Additionally, there are no visuals of boards in the first 20 seconds when Milanote is being introduced. I recommend adding a clip of your boards (not the website landing page) in this section to better showcase the platform.

To extend the video to 90 seconds, you could include an overview of the built-in templates and examples of how Milanote can be used for various creative projects, such as interior design or filmmaking.

Looking forward to seeing the updated version!",,,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9j2YSI5UUA,2024-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,,true,true,"This is perfect thank you! Please include (CTA) to live video-

Hey Elizabeth, 

You have done a fantastic job with the video and I am happy to go ahead with it :) I just had a couple of notes for some edits: 

- at the very beginning, would it be possible to avoid saying ""this section of the video is sponsored by Milanote"" and maybe just include this somewhere in the middle (For example, ""Allow me to walk you through my creative process for this space and how Milanote, who are also sponsoring this video, is helping me put together all of my exciting ideas"") to make for a smoother transition. 

- when you talk about the web clipper tool, can you please avoid showing the web page and the download process of the tool and stick to showing your boards and the web clipper tool in action. We have found that showing web pages does not add much value for the audience. 

Thanks for all your great work so far!

Hey Elizabeth, 

Your direction with the script is absolutely perfect and the example you have given for your screen recording voiceover sounds great! 

Just a reminder to make sure that you explain Milanote's features by interacting with and explaining your room makeover project because keeping in mind that your integration is 5 minutes long, sometimes it can sound like a Milanote tutorial :)

Please feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are our top tips for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click in on the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing this come to life soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Just a reminder to make sure that you explain Milanote's features by interacting with and explaining your room makeover project because keeping in mind that your integration is 5 minutes long, sometimes it can sound like a Milanote tutorial :)

Please feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are our top tips for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click in on the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing this come to life soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Hey Elizabeth,
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea—this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Just one quick feedback - while you talk about sharing the boards and collaborating it would be lovely if you could show a screen recording of yourself clicking on the share button on the Milanote board as the audience respond better to seeing the features than hearing about them. However, if this would require major edits, I am happy to let this pass this around :)

You're welcome to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creator Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s 
Many thanks, Bella",,,4,"PLEASE NOTE: This script is roughly EIGHT minutes; please let me know which sections are least important to you and can be removed to tighten it down to FIVE.

So let’s take a look at the quintessential elements of Scandinavian style, and start to create a plan for how to apply it to this bedroom, what are some unique features I’d like to bring in, how are we going to do that in classic Shannon Makes style, and help us with that task, we’re going to use Milanote, who is kindly sponsoring this portion of today’s video. Milanote is an organizational tool that can help you plan just about anything, from interior design to sewing projects! Now renovating this house is a gargantuan task, and I feel like it just invites SO many ideas, each room is basically a blank canvas for me to decorate and design, so it’s been really helpful to have a place to dump all the thoughts, images and inspiration I’ve got floating around my head, so I can keep my brain focused on the task at hand, without worrying that I’ll forget that stunning powder room that caught my eye, or that article on how to make your own plaster mouldings.

So first, let’s look at the overarching reno plan for this bedroom, which you can see I’ve titled my Castle Core Bedroom, because that’s very much what this bedroom was originally decorated as. I’ve got my main problems with the room and some To-Dos for how to fix them, then in the middle column, I’ve outlined the basic goals of the reno - what’s driving the remodel, and some basic thoughts on how I’d like to revamp it, and then some more actionable and tangible goals here, that will help make sure that all the work I do on the room is in service of these goals, plus just kind of organizing the resources I already have at hand, versus what I still need to source to finish the room.
Then, finally, the fun part - the nitty gritties of the design for the room, my FAVORITE part, so let’s take a look at the board I created for my bedroom makeover journey, Scandinavian Botanicals, because as you’ll see in a second, I leaned heavily into the foliage aspect of Scandinavian design!

So let’s start by pulling in some inspiration images, and I’ll just use a simple Google search for “Scandinavian style,” I think that’ll help give us a good idea of the overall aesthetic we’re going for here! [*Google Image searches*]. Scrolling through the images, I think this one is great, so I’m going to use the Milanote browser extension here, their Web Clipper to directly pull it into my moodboard. [*adds first image to board*]. And I really like this image because it’s kinda got all of the elements of Scandi style, which is you know, a lot of whites and warm neutrals. [*typing up a note with the bullet points on it, and adding arrow from image to board*]. We’ve got the warm wood tones, which also, like, natural materials are a key element here too, which we can see also in the jute runner, the jute basket, the woven lamp here, so we’ve got a variety of warm browns and different natural textures. And then of course, the most natural of materials, some plant life, which I really lean into that element, because I feel like, without it, it can really start to feel just very… beige 90s soccer mom. So we really want to keep it CLEAN white and BRIGHT green with some brown and beige accents. Judging by the amount of natural light in both these images it’s an UNUSUALLY BRIGHT DAY in Copenhagen! 

So if that’s our guiding image and our key elements, let’s take a look at how I applied that to my room in Denmark, because there are a couple KEY elements I want to reproduce in my Nova Scotia bedroom. And I’ve got so many images here, that I’m going to turn them into a separate board, which we can then just nest this board inside the main bedroom board [*makes new sub-board in main board]*… let’s call it Copenhagen Room. Perfect. And you can see, Milanotes got all these templates you can choose from, if you like to start with a bit of structure already baked in, they’ve got tons of options, but I think I’ll just start with an empty board, and because these are my own photographs, I’m actually going to pull them from my computer [*uploads several photos to Unsorted and starts pulling into board, organizing them while speaking]*

Ok, so here is the mushroom dresser that I designed, and you can kinda see the progression from the plain pine dresser that I found in the basement of that apartment, to the plain white version, to the final iteration with the ferns and the vintage mushroom images in their cute little gold frames. I absolutely LOVE the way it turned out, I get comments on this all the time in my older videos, and I’ve been itching to make a second version of it on this side of the ocean, so that’s going on the board. Then, other key elements from the Copenhagen bedroom, *[adds images of the whole room & other details]* we’ve got lots of white furniture, clean geometric shapes in mostly neutral colors, although of course I did bring in my purple sheets, because purple bedrooms is kinda a theme with me! There’s lots of plant life, some twinkle lights and candles for aesthetics and the quintessential Danish hygge, and cozy vibes. 

So if we take it back out to the Bedroom Makeover board, I mainly want to pull in the dresser here *[adds image of dresser on main moodboard]*, because that’s the element I want to try and copy, although I’ll probably have to adjust the design it to the dresser I have available to me*. 

So, next… I know that IKEA sells some botanical themed linens that would be absolutely perfect for this bedroom, *[searching IKEA website]* my friend actually has them on her bed, they’re like mainly white, but with little leaves and flowers. No, not this one… aha! Here it is! Now I can just click the little Milanote image in the corner here, and it will ask me which board I want to save it to, Bedroom Makeover is perfect, and then we can see that when I go back to Milanote, again, it’s sent the image over here in my Unsorted section, so I can choose where I want to put it on the board. I can not emphasize how much I enjoy this feature, it’s so simple, but so helpful for keeping things organized! So let’s just drop it over here, and then I’ll just use the crop tool to get rid of some of that white… perfect. Am I being overly fussy? Maybe, but I like designing things, whether it’s a bedroom or a moodboard, what can I say?! And now, when I click on the hyperlink in the corner of the picture, it takes me right to the IKEA page where I got it from, so if I want to keep track of resources, or eventually order that exact duvet cover online instead of driving into Halifax to visit IKEA in person, I can easily do that. 

But actually one thing I want to highlight is that I love this little touch of pink here in the bedspread and I think it’d be lovely to pull it out and maybe use it as an accent in the rest of the room so I’m going to grab a color swatch and drag it onto the board, and then I can select the exact color here, and Milanote will automatically give it a name, which is so random and kinda fun. (”*COLD TURKEY” lol)*. So now I’ll just finish filling out the board with some other key features, let’s add some plants in here, we’ve got a pothos… and can’t forget the ferns… and voila! Here’s kinda what I had in mind for the bedroom make-over, what do we think? I lowkey love this visual moodboard display, it’s so inspiring to get all my thoughts and ideas in one place, really gets me fired up to get going on this reno. And if you also feel like this sort of laying out and visual moodboarding would be helpful to YOU for your creative projects, just sort of getting all those artistic ideas out of your head and firmly in front of you, be sure to give Milanote a try - it’s available for free with no time limit, and you can sign up using the link in the description.",,,true,true,"Hey Shannon,

So if that’s our guiding image and our key elements, let’s take a look at how I applied that to my room in Denmark, because there are a couple KEY elements I want to reproduce in my Nova Scotia bedroom. And I’ve got so many images here, that I’m going to turn them into a separate board, which we can then just nest this board inside the main bedroom board [*makes new sub-board in main board]*… let’s call it Copenhagen Room. Perfect. And you can see, Milanotes got all these templates you can choose from, if you like to start with a bit of structure already baked in, they’ve got tons of options, but I think I’ll just start with an empty board, and because these are my own photographs, I’m actually going to pull them from my computer [*uploads several photos to Unsorted and starts pulling into board, organizing them while speaking]*

Ok, so here is the mushroom dresser that I designed, and you can kinda see the progression from the plain pine dresser that I found in the basement of that apartment, to the plain white version, to the final iteration with the ferns and the vintage mushroom images in their cute little gold frames. I absolutely LOVE the way it turned out, I get comments on this all the time in my older videos, and I’ve been itching to make a second version of it on this side of the ocean, so that’s going on the board. Then, other key elements from the Copenhagen bedroom, *[adds images of the whole room & other details]* we’ve got lots of white furniture, clean geometric shapes in mostly neutral colors, although of course I did bring in my purple sheets, because purple bedrooms is kinda a theme with me! There’s lots of plant life, some twinkle lights and candles for aesthetics and the quintessential Danish hygge, and cozy vibes. 

So if we take it back out to the Bedroom Makeover board, I mainly want to pull in the dresser here *[adds image of dresser on main moodboard]*, because that’s the element I want to try and copy, although I’ll probably have to adjust the design it to the dresser I have available to me*. 

So, next… I know that IKEA sells some botanical themed linens that would be absolutely perfect for this bedroom, *[searching IKEA website]* my friend actually has them on her bed, they’re like mainly white, but with little leaves and flowers. No, not this one… aha! Here it is! Now I can just click the little Milanote image in the corner here, and it will ask me which board I want to save it to, Bedroom Makeover is perfect, and then we can see that when I go back to Milanote, again, it’s sent the image over here in my Unsorted section, so I can choose where I want to put it on the board. I can not emphasize how much I enjoy this feature, it’s so simple, but so helpful for keeping things organized! So let’s just drop it over here, and then I’ll just use the crop tool to get rid of some of that white… perfect. Am I being overly fussy? Maybe, but I like designing things, whether it’s a bedroom or a moodboard, what can I say?! And now, when I click on the hyperlink in the corner of the picture, it takes me right to the IKEA page where I got it from, so if I want to keep track of resources, or eventually order that exact duvet cover online instead of driving into Halifax to visit IKEA in person, I can easily do that. 

But actually one thing I want to highlight is that I love this little touch of pink here in the bedspread and I think it’d be lovely to pull it out and maybe use it as an accent in the rest of the room so I’m going to grab a color swatch and drag it onto the board, and then I can select the exact color here, and Milanote will automatically give it a name, which is so random and kinda fun. (”*COLD TURKEY” lol)*. So now I’ll just finish filling out the board with some other key features, let’s add some plants in here, we’ve got a pothos… and can’t forget the ferns… and voila! Here’s kinda what I had in mind for the bedroom make-over, what do we think? I lowkey love this visual moodboard display, it’s so inspiring to get all my thoughts and ideas in one place, really gets me fired up to get going on this reno. And if you also feel like this sort of laying out and visual moodboarding would be helpful to YOU for your creative projects, just sort of getting all those artistic ideas out of your head and firmly in front of you, be sure to give Milanote a try - it’s available for free with no time limit, and you can sign up using the link in the description.",,,true,true,"Hey Shannon,
Wow I really appreciate how much detail you went into this script - this is fantastic!
One small suggestion - is it possible to move the CTA ""be sure to give Milanote a try - it’s available for free with no time limit, and you can sign up using the link in the description."" somewhere in the middle of the script? This is just to hopefully get the audience aware earlier that Milanote is free.
You're welcome to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creator Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s 
Many thanks, Bella",

Hey Shannon, I'm Bella and I'm excited to be working with you on this upcoming project! Thanks so much for sharing your project idea and your board example - this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it. We do want to educate the audience on Milanote being more than just a moodboarding tool, so when creating your boards, it would be great to include other board types i.e. product list, floor map. I highly recommend looking at the creative brief for board examples and video examples.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s
Looking forward to seeing your boards come together! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link) Many thanks, Bella",,,1,"I'd love to do a semi-dedicated integration as part of my bedroom redo. Here's what I had in mind:

Basically I had originally envisioned re-doing my room in a certain style, Scandinavian style, based on the three years I spent living in Denmark. I could see myself using Milanote to make the moodboard of what I had in mind for the design of the room, including some images of actual furniture I had from my room in Copenhagen, as well as other inspo images from across the internet, Pinterest, interior design sites, etc. 

That Scandi style was the ideal... but in reality (because I'm living in a tiny, rural town and doing the makeover on a tight budget), I ended up finding a thrifted duvet cover in a slightly different Scandinavian folk style, which completely changed the way I wanted to do the room, vastly different color scheme, different furniture design, etc, so potentially I could then make a second moodboard using that duvet cover as the starting piece, and building out from there for the rest of the room design.

Screen: Me talking!

Starting the Milanote introduction:

Since we are talking about the stress of planning for a wedding, I would love to introduce you all to a platform that has helped me immensely with planning many of my projects! Let’s talk about Milanote


Screen: showing Milanote logo, what Milanote looks like and some tools!

Milanote is a digital tool for organizing all of your creative projects
If you’re anything like me you are a planner, and you love seeing everything you’re planning right in front of you. Milanote offers over 100 premade templates that can assist you in things like productivity, photography, Mood boards, and even Moving.I’m actually using milanote to plan my entire move next year
In 2025 i've decided to move up to Kansas City! I want to try a new city, be closer to an airport and be closer to some good BBQ. But as you know with moving that requires so much planning. 
I don’t think anyone is eager to move BUT Milanote just made that planning 10 times easier and so much fun!


Screen: Showing off my boards and how I have built them!

So here are my boards planning out my move. I have been able to map out apartments I’m looking at and compare each of them.
And because I love mapping out my decor inspiration, I was able to make a vision board which shows the type of furniture I’m looking to have, the aesthetic, and I even created a to-do list so I’m prepared!
Screen: Back to me!

I love Milanote because it allows me to express my creativity while getting important tasks done. I can create boards that make sense and work for my way of thinking. 
I can draw, insert photos, text, sketches, and so much more that bring my vision to life.
It makes me feel less overwhelmed and so much more organized! 


Screen: Showing off weekly planner board

Another way I have been using milanote is planning out my weeks!
I love creating a digital planner and include events, deadlines, projects, etc. This planner is custom to exactly what I want and need! 
Having all of this in front of me makes it so much fun to plan out every month!

- before you say ""this is my main project board, I feel like the main project board is already being displayed for a long time - could you please click into some of your boards before this so that the audience can see a glimpse of your boards and the features Milanote has early on.
-when you talk about the web clipper can you actually show yourself using the tool to add a link/image to your video.
- when you talk about the built in templates can you actually show a couple built in templates at that point (refer to this video example at the 2:27 timestamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra-vkj23r8w&t) 
- when you say that you can share the board with your agent for feedback, could you please zoom into the comment or show yourself actually sharing it with your agent (you can blur out the comment details or your agent's details to maintain privacy if you like)

Really happy with the script as well!!

Really impressive transition from the fanfic topic to the integration. Love how well you have explained the features and tied them into your own project. Just a minor edit - instead of generally specifying that you can collaborate with other people, could you please give a specific example of someone you'd share your work with or get feedback from? Could you also please briefly talk about the feature of being able to handwrite/draw on the board as I noticed that you have a handwritten note in the ""mommy issues"" board. 

Other than that, happy to move forward and get you to start recording your draft video. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your home board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Best, 
Himika",,,4,"You really got to admire the creativity that people put into writing these fanfiction. Is it weird for me to say that this inspires me to get back into writing too? Obviously not for this specific topic, but fanfiction really shows you can write about anything and have fun with it, and I wanna get back into that. So as I'm working on a book deal for my first novel with my agent, I've been thinking about what my second book could be, and I decided to use Milanote to put together ideas. They're also the sponsor of today's video.

I've talked about them before, but if you don't know, Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects. I'm currently using them to brainstorm ideas and inspiration for my second book. It’s perfect for visual-thinkers, because it allows you to organize your ideas in a way that makes sense to you.

This is my main project board. As I plan out my project, I've organized my thoughts into several sub-boards, like characters, settings, themes, and situations. Let's get into ""mommy issues"" since you're probably most curious about that. I gather inspiration from things I see on twitter, pinterest, music I like, even memes. Like if I see something online that makes me think this could be relevant to my book, I just use Milanote Web Clipper to link directly to my boards from any website. It's super quick and easy and I like that the system is so flexible that I can collect notes, images, videos, tasks and more all in one place.

Whether you're a filmmaker, writer, interior designer or creative hobbyist, Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. When you're ready to share your work, you can invite your colleagues and clients or agent in my case to gather important feedback and collaborate with them in real-time.

Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project. If you enjoy using Milanote, let me know about your projects and what you do on there!",,,true,true,"Really happy with the script as well!!

Really impressive transition from the fanfic topic to the integration. Love how well you have explained the features and tied them into your own project. Just a minor edit - instead of generally specifying that you can collaborate with other people, could you please give a specific example of someone you'd share your work with or get feedback from? Could you also please briefly talk about the feature of being able to handwrite/draw on the board as I noticed that you have a handwritten note in the ""mommy issues"" board. 

Other than that, happy to move forward and get you to start recording your draft video. Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your home board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. But keep in mind to not get carried away with too many visual effects as it can make it hard for the audience to actually pay attention to your beautiful boards. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing a draft of your video soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!!

Is it weird for me to say that this inspires me to get back into writing too? Obviously not for this specific topic, but fanfiction really shows you can write about anything and have fun with it, and I wanna get back into that. So as I'm working on a book deal for my first novel with my agent, I've been thinking about what my second book could be, and I decided to use Milanote to put together ideas. They're also the sponsor of today's video.

I've talked about them before, but if you don't know, Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects. I'm currently using them to brainstorm ideas and inspiration for my second book. It’s perfect for visual-thinkers, because it allows you to organize your ideas in a way that makes sense to you.

This is my main project board. As I plan out my project, I've organized my thoughts into several sub-boards, like characters, settings, themes, and situations. Let's get into ""mommy issues"" since you're probably most curious about that. I gather inspiration from things I see on twitter, pinterest, music I like, even memes. Like if I see something online that makes me think this could be relevant to my book, I just use Milanote Web Clipper to link directly to my boards from any website. It's super quick and easy and I like that the system is so flexible that I can collect notes, images, videos, tasks and more all in one place.

Whether you're a filmmaker, writer, interior designer or creative hobbyist, Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. When you're ready to share your work, you can invite your colleagues and clients or agent in my case to gather important feedback and collaborate with them in real-time.

Hey Rosie,
Thank you for sharing your script - I love how you naturally brought both your project and Milanote into the conversation. Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

I’ve been figuring out the design for this porch and deck. I started by taking measurements, and drew up the existing plan and elevations in AutoCAD. I’ve been gathering references and images to figure out what I want to do with this area and this time I put everything together using Milanote. Milanote is a tool for organising your creative projects and they are kindly sponsoring this video. 

I’ve been keen to try Milanote because every time I start a new project it’s difficult to keep all my resources in one place. I’ll have pieces of paper with my material lists, images on Pinterest, websites that I forget about, and this is a way to keep all those things in one place. 

I started by creating a mood board with my main inspiration. You can start a new board from scratch but I used the interior design moodboard template, to have something to start with and then I can move things around as I see fit. I downloaded the Milanote web clipper extension so I can save images from anywhere on the Internet and they will go straight to the board I’m working on. 

I’ve been looking at the construction for the deck, seating and some decorative details to fix up this remnant of a sad old porch. It’s fun to throw in pictures and use the arrows to highlight important details. I pulled out the colours I’m working with and created a separate board that includes the links to the websites where I can purchase them. 

My second board goes into a bit more detail with my rendered elevations. I want to clad the porch and add some traditional detailing. I’ve pulled out a few options, and added some ideas for seating along the wall.

The best thing is being able to add all the references I will be using for the deck construction. This one links to a really useful illustration I found and I have some links to hardware store websites that have guides on how to build a deck. I also have my to do list right here, and I can tick these tasks as I finish them, or move them around as needed.

My last board is something that usually gets scribbled down in a notebook somewhere, but I added my plan for the deck and calculated all the wood and materials I need to order. I’m also going to add a column for the porch, so I’m going to duplicate the one I have, and have it ready for when I need it.

I really like how Milanote has the ability to not only include images, but also links and lists to keep everything related to the project in one place. You can also invite others, team members or clients to collaborate on boards or add feedback so this can be used for one person projects like mine but also on a much larger scale.

From a brand positioning perspective, amongst all the other fashion brands with sans-serif-itis, on the scale of how much audacity do their products have and how little am I able to afford it, Balenciaga is up there.

[Project board 2]

But here’s the thing, for a brand that sells [items], the logo is giving more blandciaga haha am I right? You can see in this timeline that Balenciaga used to have a more sophisticated look when that was their brand direction, a focus on craftmanship you can see in the stitching in this logo. As creative direction changed they then started morphing. To organise this project I’m using the tool Milanote.

[Milanote logo]

[screen recording of making project board 2] Because it acts like a big online canvas where I can both plan the project, and also organise my brain dumps. [clip of annotation on board] Like this thought-provoking idea. 

To yassify the balenciaga logo I first wanted to understand Balenciaga’s brand. For virtually all parts, I modified one of their 100 built-in templates. I know the template button hates to see me coming. [clicking into mooodboard 1] [screenrecording of moodboard 1] This moodboard showcasing both what Balenciaga sells and their more editorial pieces. You can lay it out in a way that makes sense to you with a very intuitive user interface when adding images, videos, captions, notes or sketches.

[template examples] So it smooths the process of like planning your dissertation, writing or doing commercial design work it adapts to your organisational needs. So whether you're more of a visual planner or want a space to brainstorm from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

[Moodboard 2] 

When thinking about how we want the new logo to look like, the main idea to communicate is the avante-garde. This theme was around mixed type - something futuristic and a bit edgier or if we look at examples of other brands with iconography because you don’t really see that with luxury fashion. It’s easy to group ideas and link them together into a cluster like an interactive Pinterest board that you can nest within itself. And if you’re overthinking your work like me or working on a group projects and need feedback you can invite your team to collaborate in real time, I’m something of a lone-wolf myself so I pretended to be my own boss and leave a review [screen recording of comment].

From a brand positioning perspective, amongst all the other fashion brands with sans-serif-itis, on the scale of how much audacity do their products have and how little am I able to afford it, Balenciaga is up there.

[Project board 2]

But here’s the thing, for a brand that sells [items], the logo is giving more blandciaga haha am I right? You can see in this timeline that Balenciaga used to have a more sophisticated look when that was their brand direction, a focus on craftmanship you can see in the stitching in this logo. As creative direction changed they then started morphing. To organise this project I’m using the tool Milanote.

[Milanote logo]

[screen recording of making project board 2] Because it acts like a big online canvas where I can both plan the project, and also organise my brain dumps. [clip of annotation on board] Like this thought-provoking idea. 

To yassify the balenciaga logo I first wanted to understand Balenciaga’s brand. For virtually all parts, I modified one of their 100 built-in templates. I know the template button hates to see me coming. [clicking into mooodboard 1] [screenrecording of moodboard 1] This moodboard showcasing both what Balenciaga sells and their more editorial pieces. You can lay it out in a way that makes sense to you with a very intuitive user interface when adding images, videos, captions, notes or sketches.

[template examples] So it smooths the process of like planning your dissertation, writing or doing commercial design work it adapts to your organisational needs. So whether you're more of a visual planner or want a space to brainstorm from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

[Moodboard 2] 

When thinking about how we want the new logo to look like, the main idea to communicate is the avante-garde. This theme was around mixed type - something futuristic and a bit edgier or if we look at examples of other brands with iconography because you don’t really see that with luxury fashion. It’s easy to group ideas and link them together into a cluster like an interactive Pinterest board that you can nest within itself. And if you’re overthinking your work like me or working on a group projects and need feedback you can invite your team to collaborate in real time, I’m something of a lone-wolf myself so I pretended to be my own boss and leave a review [screen recording of comment]. Look it’s me working with myself but this could be your group.

Hey Adrien, 

Great work on the script - happy to move forward with it :))

Just two minor additions: 
1. At some point in the video can you show a couple of the built-in templates and point out that ""Milanote has over a 100-built-in templates for a variety of different creative areas to make it easier to start a new project"" (just want the audience to know that it is not just limited to photography projects. 

2. Where you talk about checklists and gear, could also include a shot of yourself checking things off on the mobile app and talk about how easy it is to use Milanote on the go as well? This one is just a suggestion but would love it if you could include this somehow :)


Feel free to get started on your draft video now. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings: 

Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board) 
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Himika",,,4,"I just want to take a minute before moving to the next point to thank today’s video sponsor, Milanote, the best tool for organising creative projects.

I often go on photography day trips and I love the unexpected aspect of walking the area and finding great locations randomly but that doesn’t mean I don’t do any sort of planning.

I love using Milanote because I can make a very visual representation of how I get organised for the trip.

There is all sorts of tools like to-do list or shot list. You can insert simple notes, photos, videos  tables and more.

It works in this board kind of layout and you can customise it to your liking, grouping some notes together by theme or anything that helps you visualise your whole project.

For example I recently went on a photography day-trip in Iwakuni and here’s how I made my board.

Starting on the left with a global description about the project, what, where and how I will shoot. I inserted a link to google maps with some locations I saved as fallback if I find myself not knowing where to go. Very important, I also included an inspiration mood board with some pictures I sourced online.

Then I made a group with anything logistics. 1 click links to have the itinerary to go and come back from Iwakuni. I also put a nice lunch spot and weather predictions. That made me think about how I typically shoot in these condition so I linked some bullet points to help me but also it is something relevant I could talk about in camera.

Then I have a gear checklist to make sure I bring everything and a shot list so I don’t forget anything I wanted to talk to make my video more interesting.

I really like the last column too because it serves as a wrap up, a little rewards to myself showing the best photos I took during that day. It’s also a very good starting point to build some photo sets I will be sharing online.

Hey Adrien, 

Thanks for getting back to me with your revised project idea. I am happy to move forward with the first one you mentioned about planning the street photography day trip. I feel like this will fit better with the kind of content you have already been creating on your channel :) 

Excited to be collaborating with you on this!

The next step for you will be to start drafting your Milanote boards which showcase how you would use Milanote to actually plan and organize the street photography day trip.  

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link).

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link).

Hey Adrien, 

Thanks for sharing your project idea with me. While you are heading in the right direction in discussing the various aspects of planning you would use Milanote for, I was wondering if you could please base the integration around planning a street photography project instead of how you plan your YouTube videos. Let me know your thoughts on this :)

In terms of video publish date, feel free to take your time and we are happy for you to publish it in August, instead of this month. 

Many thanks, 
Himika",,,1,"I can talk about how I use Milanote to plan a street photography daytrip. Showing how I use checklists to make sure that I bring everything I need, how I make a moodboard to have inspiration if I feel stuck during the day, how I create a space for note taking if I struck interesting ideas or thoughts while shooting and how I can put some keywords giving me a direction for that day of shooting.
I can also talk how I use Milanote to put together and track a bigger street photography project. Dumping photos onto a board to see how they work together and making some sequencing for a future Zine or photobook.",,,true,true,"Hey Adrien, 

Thanks for getting back to me with your revised project idea. I am happy to move forward with the first one you mentioned about planning the street photography day trip. I feel like this will fit better with the kind of content you have already been creating on your channel :)

Hey Caroline, wonderful job with your video! I love seeing how you interacted with the boards on screen. One small suggestion - is it possible for you to add a clip of your boards in the first 1 minute (13:00 - 14:00) of the integration? You could include a highlight clip of your boards zoomed out.

Hey Sarah, you did an awesome job with this script! Can't wait to see the draft video! Many thanks, Bella",,,4,"But first let me tell you how I planned this cosplay with the help of todays sponsor,
Milanote.
Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects,
And it has quickly become my favorite way to plan out all the details of making a
cosplay.
I like to work from a totally blank board on milanote but you can actually choose from
over 100 built in templates. But my mind is chaos, so I appreciate that they let you do
anything you want
Obviously first thing I need is reference photos to look at, so that I can get to fabric
shopping, so
I just drag and drop photos onto the board
I love a to-do list, and I like to use them to keep track of what order things need to be
done in.
And I create a moodboard to keep inspired, and to see every angle of the costume
To keep all my links organized I put them all in a sub board
I needed a pattern for this, so i threw that link in as well, and I love that milanote
displays a thumbnail for it, so I actually know what i'm looking at.
Then I start looking for fabric, I knew going in I wanted to look locally for the fancy stuff,
but the base fabrics I could just get online, so I wrote out a plan of what I wanted, found
links to fabrics that work, and put them all in a Column, to keep them organized, and to
remind me which thing was for what, and how much I needed.
You can also use milanote to keep track of your budget, just add in a table and you've
got a mini spreadsheet right there on the board, and for the spreadsheet deficient
people like me, you can pull the formulas up on the side.
You can also download the Milanote app, and have this whole plan with you when you
go fabric shopping and make sure you dont go over budget, or quickly get to your
reference photo without having to dig through all the photos on your phone
Or if you like paper planning, you can build the whole board on milanote, save it as a
pdf, and print the whole thing out
I make a milanote board for every cosplay I make now, I really do, and I highly
recommend it as a powerful tool for organizing your creative projects
And its Totally free to sign up, with no time limit on it being free, So Use the link in the
description to try it out for your next cosplay or creative project.
And if you’re already using Milanote, I know some of you are, let me know in the

Hey Desi, 
The script is absolutely perfect - I am genuinely impressed!! I love how you have brought forward Milanote's value so well and how you plan on interacting with your boards to show  all the features by linking them to your project. This is exactly what we look for - such an authentic way to integrate Milanote. 

Just one small edit - where you say ""whether you're a filmmaker or videographer, Youtuber or content creator"" can you please add ""or a creative in general"", so that the audience know that Milanote can be used for other types of creative work too :)

Other than that, I am happy to approve this and for you to get started on your draft video.

Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief as well for further reference and inspiration. 

Looking forward to seeing your draft video soon and thank you for all your great work so far!!

",,,4,"I am so excited to be working with one Milanote again, I am such a huge huge fan. I use milanote all the time to organize film projects and also it’s my favorite place to create mood boards. Let me show you what the process looks like for me.

Milanote is great tool for organizing your creative projects. It allows you to collect notes, images, videos, tasks and more - all in one place. I’m currently using Milanote to do the pre-production for this current video that you’re watching right now. It’s perfect for filmmakers, Youtubers and content creators because it allows you to organize your ideas in a way that makes sense to you. I personally have to get everything out of my brain and organized in a visual way, and Milanote is especially helpful for that. being a very visual person. Instead of writing my ideas down in a notebook, I’m able to add filming locations, songs I think that would fit well, all the gear I plan to use and a mood board that I create for every video I film all in one place.

This is my main project board, and as I plan out my project, I organize all the parts into several sub-boards, including a mood board and shot list. 

I like to collect photos as reference from various places online using the Milanote Web Clipper. This makes saving images and videos directly to my boards super quick and easy. Photos are one of my main sources of inspiration.

Creating a mood board really helps me visualize what I want the end result of my video to look like. I love personalizing it with adding text, drawing, color swatches, stickers and more.

Whether you're a filmmaker or videographer, Youtuber or content creator, Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. I used the mood board template but as you can see, there are so many to choose from.

When you're ready to share your work, you can invite anyone on your team to gather important feedback and collaborate with them in real-time. For example, I shared this board with Jared to get his feedback on locations and dates we plan to film together.

Finally, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit.

Hi Samyam,

Thanks for sharing your draft video. Overall, I think the mention looks really good! My only suggestion before you go live is to reduce the zoom in the screen recordings. We don't mind having a few zoomed-in shots when showing features or boards, but it's important to also show the whole interface. This will help users who are new to Milanote understand where you drag and drop cards, pictures, and color swatches from.

Please let me know once the revised video is ready.

Hey Samyam,
Thank you for sharing your script - this is great! I love how you mention you're already a PRO user and how you naturally brought both your Milanote project into the conversation.
Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s
For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.

""Making a full game is an entirely different experience than a small game jam- it's now much more challenging, and that's when we have to deploy Step 4, the most important step, of the 7 Step Blueprint formula for success - Planning.

And one of the best tools to do this is Milanote, the sponsor of today's video. Trust me when I say I already had a yearly PRO subscription to this service before this.

Milanote is a visual tool for organizing any sort of creative project. It consists of boards where you can place anything from text, to images, to tables, and my favorite part are sub-boards, so you can easily keep things neat. 

Heck, I even wrote the script to this video in Milanote!

My favorite part is it's seamless online collaboration, so I can easily invite my friend to my board and we can edit it in real-time.

They also have tons of templates that you can use to plan your games.
Like this Brainstorming one where you can post inspiration images and brain dump your ideas into.

Once you've come up with a basic idea for your game, you can start filling out your Game Design Document, sort of like a blueprint for how to build your game.

This can include a mood board, which is how you want people to feel while playing your game and the color schemes you want to use, a very important step in making your game stand out among thousands of others. 

From there you can figure out the Story behind the game, the characters, their relationships, the level design, and how the general flow of the game will work.

They have a ton of different elements which are an easy drag and drop to use, and you can even add some handwriting to your  boards.

Milanote has a great starting template for each of these steps.

And once you've determined the gameplay, you can easily keep track of development milestones and your budget all in Milanote. 

There are literally an infinite amount of uses for this tool and and they have great example use cases to get you started.

It's the tool I use for almost everything and I highly recommend it for any creative project. You can sign up completely free with no subscription in the link down below. """,,,true,true,"Hey Samyam,
Thank you for sharing your script - this is great! I love how you mention you're already a PRO user and how you naturally brought both your Milanote project into the conversation.
Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box https://milanote.com/samyam ).
